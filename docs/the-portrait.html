            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br><span class="year">1881</span></p>
            
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>At the period when the following incidents occurred, I was living with my father at
               <span class="place">The Grove</span>, a large old house in the immediate neighborhood of a little town. This had been
               his home for a number of years; and I believe I was born in it. It was a kind of house
               which, notwithstanding all the red and white architecture known at present by the
               name of <span class="character">Queen Anne</span>, builders nowadays have forgotten how to build. It was straggling and irregular,
               with wide passages, wide staircases, broad landings; the rooms large but not very
               lofty; the arrangements leaving much to be desired, with no economy of space; a house
               belonging to a period when land was cheap, and, so far as that was concerned, there
               was no occasion to economize. Though it was so near the town, the clump of trees in
               which it was environed was a veritable grove. In the grounds in spring the primroses
               grew as thickly as in the forest. We had a few fields for the cows, and an excellent
               walled garden. The place is being pulled down at this moment to make room for more
               streets of mean little houses,—the kind of thing, and not a dull house of faded gentry,
               which perhaps the neighborhood requires. The house was dull, and so were we, its last
               inhabitants; and the furniture was faded, even a little dingy,—nothing to brag of.
               I do not, however, intend to convey a suggestion that we were faded gentry, for that
               was not the case. My father, indeed, was rich, and had no need to spare any expense
               in making his life and his house bright if he pleased; but he did not please, and
               I had not been long enough at home to exercise any special influence of my own. It
               was the only home I had ever known; but except in my earliest childhood, and in my
               holidays as a schoolboy, I had in reality known but little of it. My mother had died
               at my birth, or shortly after, and I had grown up in the gravity and silence of a
               house without women. In my infancy, I believe, a sister of my father’s had lived with
               us, and taken charge of the household and of me; but she, too, had died long, long
               ago, my mourning for her being one of the first things I could recollect. And she
               had no successor. There were, indeed, a housekeeper and some maids,—the latter of
               whom I only saw disappearing at the end of a passage, or whisking out of a room when
               one of “the gentlemen” appeared. <span class="character">Mrs. Weir</span>, indeed, I saw nearly every day; but a curtsey, a smile, a pair of nice round arms
               which she caressed while folding them across her ample waist, and a large white apron,
               were all I knew of her. This was the only female influence in the house. The drawing-room
               I was aware of only as a place of deadly good order, into which nobody ever entered.
               It had three long windows opening on the lawn, and communicated at the upper end,
               which was rounded like a great bay, with the conservatory. Sometimes I gazed into
               it as a child from without, wondering at the needlework on the chairs, the screens,
               the looking-glasses which never reflected any living face. My father did not like
               the room, which probably was not wonderful, though it never occurred to me in those
               early days to inquire why.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>I may say here, though it will probably be disappointing to those who form a sentimental
               idea of the capabilities of children, that it did not occur to me either, in these
               early days, to make any inquiry about my mother. There was no room in life, as I knew
               it, for any such person; nothing suggested to my mind either the fact that she must
               have existed, or that there was need of her in the house. I accepted, as I believe
               most children do, the facts of existence, on the basis with which I had first made
               acquaintance with them, without question or remark. As a matter of fact, I was aware
               that it was rather dull at home; but neither by comparison with the books I read,
               nor by the communications received from my school-fellows, did this seem to me anything
               remarkable. And I was possibly somewhat dull too by nature, for I did not mind. I
               was fond of reading, and for that there was unbounded opportunity. I had a little
               ambition in respect to work, and that too could be prosecuted undisturbed. When I
               went to the university, my society lay almost entirely among men; but by that time
               and afterwards, matters had of course greatly changed with me, and though I recognized
               women as part of the economy of nature, and did not indeed by any means dislike or
               avoid them, yet the idea of connecting them at all with my own home never entered
               into my head. That continued to be as it had always been, when at intervals I descended
               upon the cool, grave, colorless place, in the midst of my traffic with the world:
               always very still, well-ordered, serious,—the cooking very good, the comfort perfect;
               old <span class="character">Morphew</span>, the butler, a little older (but very little older, perhaps on the whole less old,
               since in my childhood I had thought him a kind of Methuselah); and <span class="character">Mrs. Weir</span>, less active, covering up her arms in sleeves, but folding and caressing them just
               as always. I remember looking in from the lawn through the windows upon that deadly-orderly
               drawing-room, with a humorous recollection of my childish admiration and wonder, and
               feeling that it must be kept so forever and ever, and that to go into it would break
               some sort of amusing mock mystery, some pleasantly ridiculous spell.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>But it was only at rare intervals that I went home. In the long vacation, as in my
               school holidays, my father often went abroad with me, so that we had gone over a great
               deal of the Continent together very pleasantly. He was old in proportion to the age
               of his son, being a man of sixty when I was twenty, but that did not disturb the pleasure
               of the relations between us. I don’t know that they were ever very confidential. On
               my side there was but little to communicate, for I did not get into scrapes nor fall
               in love, the two predicaments which demand sympathy and confidences. And as for my
               father himself, I was never aware what there could be to communicate on his side.
               I knew his life exactly,—what he did almost at every hour of the day; under what circumstances
               of the temperature he would ride and when walk; how often and with what guests he
               would indulge in the occasional break of a dinner-party, a serious pleasure,—perhaps,
               indeed, less a pleasure than a duty. All this I knew as well as he did, and also his
               views on public matters, his political opinions, which naturally were different from
               mine. What ground, then, remained for confidence? I did not know any. We were both
               of us of a reserved nature, not apt to enter into our religious feelings, for instance.
               There are many people who think reticence on such subjects a sign of the most reverential
               way of contemplating them. Of this I am far from being sure; but, at all events, it
               was the practice most congenial to my own mind.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br>And then I was for a long time absent, making my own way in the world. I did not make
               it very successfully. I accomplished the natural fate of an Englishman, and went out
               to the <span class="place">Colonies</span>; then to <span class="place">India</span> in a semi-diplomatic position; but returned home after seven or eight years, invalided,
               in bad health and not much better spirits, tired and disappointed with my first trial
               of life. I had, as people say, <span class="quote">“no occasion”</span> to insist on making my way. My father was rich, and had never given me the slightest
               reason to believe that he did not intend me to be his heir. His allowance to me was
               not illiberal, and though he did not oppose the carrying out of my own plans, he by
               no means urged me to exertion. When I came home he received me very affectionately,
               and expressed his satisfaction in my return. <span class="quote">“Of course,”</span> he said, <span class="quote">“I am not glad that you are disappointed, <span class="character">Philip</span>, or that your health is broken; but otherwise it is an ill wind, you know, that blows
                  nobody good; and I am very glad to have you at home. I am growing an old man—”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“I don’t see any difference, sir,” said I; “everything here seems exactly the same
                  as when I went away—”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br>He smiled, and shook his head.<span class="quote"> “It is true enough,” he said; “after we have reached a certain age we seem to go
                  on for a long time on a plane, and feel no great difference from year to year; but
                  it is an inclined plane, and the longer we go on the more sudden will be the fall
                  at the end. But at all events it will be a great comfort to me to have you here.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“If I had known that,” I said, “and that you wanted me, I should have come in any
                  circumstances. As there are only two of us in the world—”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Yes,” he said, “there are only two of us in the world; but still I should not have
                  sent for you, <span class="character">Phil</span>, to interrupt your career.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br><span class="quote">“It is as well, then, that it has interrupted itself,”</span> I said rather bitterly; for disappointment is hard to bear.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>He patted me on the shoulder, and repeated, <span class="quote">“It is an ill wind that blows nobody good,”</span> with a look of real pleasure which gave me a certain gratification too; for, after
               all, he was an old man, and the only one in all the world to whom I owed any duty.
               I had not been without dreams of warmer affections, but they had come to nothing—not
               tragically, but in the ordinary way. I might perhaps have had love which I did not
               want but not that which I did want,—which was not a thing to make any unmanly moan
               about, but in the ordinary course of events. Such disappointments happen every day;
               indeed, they are more common than anything else, and sometimes it is apparent afterwards
               that it is better it was so.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>However, here I was at thirty stranded, yet wanting for nothing,—in a position to
               call forth rather envy than pity from the greater part of my contemporaries; for I
               had an assured and comfortable existence, as much money as I wanted, and the prospect
               of an excellent fortune for the future. On the other hand, my health was still low,
               and I had no occupation. The neighborhood of the town was a drawback rather than an
               advantage. I felt myself tempted, instead of taking the long walk into the country
               which my doctor recommended, to take a much shorter one through the <span class="place">High Street</span>, across the river, and back again, which was not a walk but a lounge. The country
               was silent and full of thoughts,—thoughts not always very agreeable,—whereas there
               were always the humors of the little urban population to glance at, the news to be
               heard,—all those petty matters which so often make up life in a very impoverished
               version for the idle man. I did not like it, but I felt myself yielding to it, not
               having energy enough to make a stand. The rector and the leading lawyer of the place
               asked me to dinner. I might have glided into the society, such as it was, had I been
               disposed for that; everything about me began to close over me as if I had been fifty,
               and fully contented with my lot.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>It was possibly my own want of occupation which made me observe with surprise, after
               a while, how much occupied my father was. He had expressed himself glad of my return;
               but now that I had returned, I saw very little of him. Most of his time was spent
               in his library, as had always been the case. But on the few visits I paid him there,
               I could not but perceive that the aspect of the library was much changed. It had acquired
               the look of a business-room, almost an office. There were large business-like books
               on the table, which I could not associate with anything he could naturally have to
               do; and his correspondence was very large. I thought he closed one of those books
               hurriedly as I came in, and pushed it away, as if he did not wish me to see it. This
               surprised me at the moment without arousing any other feeling; but afterwards I remembered
               it with a clearer sense of what it meant. He was more absorbed altogether than I had
               been used to see him. He was visited by men sometimes not of very prepossessing appearance.
               Surprise grew in my mind without any very distinct idea of the reason of it; and it
               was not till after a chance conversation with <span class="character">Morphew</span> that my vague uneasiness began to take definite shape. It was begun without any special
               intention on my part. <span class="character">Morphew</span> had informed me that master was very busy, on some occasion when I wanted to see
               him. And I was a little annoyed to be thus put off. <span class="quote">“It appears to me that my father is always busy,”</span> I said hastily. <span class="character">Morphew</span> then began very oracularly to nod his head in assent.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“A deal too busy, sir, if you take my opinion,”</span> he said.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>This startled me much, and I asked hurriedly, <span class="quote">“What do you mean?”</span> without reflecting that to ask for private information from a servant about my father’s
               habits was as bad as investigating into a stranger’s affairs. It did not strike me
               in the same light.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“<span class="character">Mr. Philip</span>,” said <span class="character">Morphew</span>, “a thing ’as ’appened as ’appens more often than it ought to. Master has got awful
                  keen about money in his old age.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: ironic]</span><br><span class="quote">“That’s a new thing for him,”</span> I said.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“No, sir, begging your pardon, it ain’t a new thing. He was once broke of it, and
                  that wasn’t easy done; but it’s come back, if you’ll excuse me saying so. And I don’t
                  know as he’ll ever be broke of it again at his age.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: anger]</span><br>I felt more disposed to be angry than disturbed by this. <span class="quote">“You must be making some ridiculous mistake,”</span> I said. <span class="quote">“And if you were not so old a friend as you are, <span class="character">Morphew</span>, I should not have allowed my father to be so spoken of to me.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>The old man gave me a half-astonished, half-contemptuous look. <span class="quote">“He’s been my master a deal longer than he’s been your father,”</span> he said, turning on his heel. The assumption was so comical that my anger could not
               stand in face of it. I went out, having been on my way to the door when this conversation
               occurred, and took my usual lounge about, which was not a satisfactory sort of amusement.
               Its vanity and emptiness appeared to be more evident than usual to-day. I met half-a-dozen
               people I knew, and had as many pieces of news confided to me. I went up and down the
               length of the <span class="place">High Street</span>. I made a small purchase or two. And then I turned homeward, despising myself, yet
               finding no alternative within my reach. Would a long country walk have been more virtuous?
               It would at least have been more wholesome; but that was all that could be said. My
               mind did not dwell on <span class="character">Morphew’s</span> communication. It seemed without sense or meaning to me; and after the excellent
               joke about his superior interest in his master to mine in my father, was dismissed
               lightly enough from my mind. I tried to invent some way of telling this to my father
               without letting him perceive that <span class="character">Morphew</span> had been finding faults in him, or I listening; for it seemed a pity to lose so good
               a joke. However, as I returned home, something happened which put the joke entirely
               out of my head. It is curious when a new subject of trouble or anxiety has been suggested
               to the mind in an unexpected way, how often a second advertisement follows immediately
               after the first, and gives to that a potency which in itself it had not possessed.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>I was approaching our own door, wondering whether my father had gone, and whether,
               on my return, I should find him at leisure,—for I had several little things to say
               to him,—when I noticed a poor woman lingering about the closed gates. She had a baby
               sleeping in her arms. It was a spring night, the stars shining in the twilight, and
               everything soft and dim; and the woman’s figure was like a shadow, flitting about,
               now here, now there, on one side or another of the gate. She stopped when she saw
               me approaching, and hesitated for a moment, then seemed to take a sudden resolution.
               I watched her without knowing, with a prevision that she was going to address me,
               though with no sort of idea as to the subject of her address. She came up to me doubtfully,
               it seemed, yet certainly, as I felt, and when she was close to me, dropped a sort
               of hesitating curtsey, and said, <span class="quote">“It’s <span class="character">Mr. Philip</span>?”</span> in a low voice.
               </p>

               flood of words which must have been all ready and waiting at the doors of her lips
               for utterance. <span class="quote">“Oh, sir, I want to speak to you! I can’t believe you’ll be so hard, for you’re young;
                  and I can’t believe he’ll be so hard if so be as his own son, as I’ve always heard
                  he had but one, ’ll speak up for us. Oh, gentleman, it is easy for the likes of you,
                  that, if you ain’t comfortable in one room, can just walk into another; but if one
                  room is all you have, and every bit of furniture you have taken out of it, and nothing
                  but the four walls left,—not so much as the cradle for the child, or a chair for your
                  man to sit down upon when he comes from his work, or a saucepan to cook him his supper—”</span>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“You say it’s cruel!”</span> she cried with a sort of triumph. <span class="quote">“Oh, I knowed you would, or any true gentleman that don’t hold with screwing poor

                  what he’s doing, driving poor creatures to despair. Summer’s coming, the Lord be praised,
                  but yet it’s bitter cold at night with your counterpane gone; and when you’ve been
                  working hard all day, and nothing but four bare walls to come home to, and all your

                  one, all gone, and you no better than when you started, or rather worse, for then
                  you was young. Oh, sir!”</span> the woman’s voice rose into a sort of passionate wail. And then she added, beseechingly,

               faltering, <span class="quote">“It’s <span class="character">Mr. Philip</span>?”</span> as if that made everything right.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Yes; I am <span class="character">Philip Canning</span>,” I said; “but what have I to do with this? and to whom am I to speak?”</span>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br>She began to whimper, crying and stopping herself. <span class="quote">“Oh, please, sir! it’s <span class="character">Mr. Canning</span> as owns all the house property about; it’s him that our court and the lane and everything

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Oh, God bless you, sir,”</span> said the woman. But then she added, in a lower tone, <span class="quote">“It’s no agent. It’s one as never knows trouble. It’s him that lives in that grand
                  house.”</span> But this was said under her breath, evidently not for me to hear.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="character">Morphew’s</span> words flashed through my mind as she spoke. What was this? Did it afford an explanation
               of the much-occupied hours, the big books, the strange visitors? I took the poor woman’s
               name, and gave her something to procure a few comforts for the night, and went indoors
               disturbed and troubled. It was impossible to believe that my father himself would
               have acted thus; but he was not a man to brook interference, and I did not see how
               to introduce the subject, what to say. I could but hope that, at the moment of broaching
               it, words would be put into my mouth, which often happens in moments of necessity,
               one knows not how, even when one’s theme is not so all-important as that for which
               such help has been promised. As usual, I did not see my father till dinner. I have
               said that our dinners were very good, luxurious in a simple way, everything excellent
               in its kind, well cooked, well served,—the perfection of comfort without show,—which
               is a combination very dear to the English heart. I said nothing till Morphew, with
               his solemn attention to everything that was going, had retired; and then it was with
               some strain of courage that I began.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br><span class="quote">“My mother!”</span> the reference was so unusual—nay, so unprecedented—that I was greatly startled. It
               seemed to me like the sudden introduction of a quite new element in the stagnant atmosphere,
               as well as a new party to our conversation. My father looked across the table, as
               if with some astonishment at my tone of surprise.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Is that so very extraordinary?”</span> he said.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“No; of course it is not extraordinary that I should resemble my mother. Only—I have

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br><span class="quote">“That is true.”</span> He got up and placed himself before the fire, which was very low, as the night was
               not cold—had not been cold heretofore at least; but it seemed to me now that a little
               chill came into the dim and faded room. Perhaps it looked more dull from the suggestion
               of a something brighter, warmer, that might have been. <span class="quote">“Talking of mistakes,” he said, “perhaps that was one: to sever you entirely from
                  her side of the house. But I did not care for the connection. You will understand
                  how it is that I speak of it now when I tell you—”</span> He stopped here, however, said nothing more for a minute or so, and then rang the
               bell. <span class="character">Morphew</span> came, as he always did, very deliberately, so that some time elapsed in silence,
               during which my surprise grew. When the old man appeared at the door—<span class="quote">“Have you put the lights in the drawing-room, as I told you?”</span> my father said.
               </p>

               him. My father did so with a wave of his hand.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“That’s enough. I asked no information. You can go now.”</span>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>The door closed upon us, and there was again a pause. My subject had floated away
               altogether like a mist, though I had been so concerned about it. I tried to resume,
               but could not. Something seemed to arrest my very breathing; and yet in this dull,
               respectable house of ours, where everything breathed good character and integrity,
               it was certain that there could be no shameful mystery to reveal. It was some time
               before my father spoke, not from any purpose that I could see, but apparently because
               his mind was busy with probably unaccustomed thoughts.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“You scarcely know the drawing-room, <span class="character">Phil</span>,”</span> he said at last.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Very little. I have never seen it used. I have a little awe of it, to tell the truth.”</span>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“That should not be. There is no reason for that. But a man by himself, as I have
                  been for the greater part of my life, has no occasion for a drawing-room. I always,
                  as a matter of preference, sat among my books; however, I ought to have thought of
                  the impression on you.”</span>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Oh, it is not important,” I said; “the awe was childish. I have not thought of it
                  since I came home.”</span>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“It never was anything very splendid at the best,”</span> said he. He lifted the lamp from the table with a sort of abstraction, not remarking
               even my offer to take it from him, and led the way. He was on the verge of seventy,
               and looked his age; but it was a vigorous age, with no symptom of giving way. The
               circle of light from the lamp lit up his white hair and keen blue eyes and clear complexion;
               his forehead was like old ivory, his cheek warmly colored; an old man, yet a man in
               full strength. He was taller than I was, and still almost as strong. As he stood for
               a moment with the lamp in his hand, he looked like a tower in his great height and
               bulk. I reflected as I looked at him that I knew him intimately, more intimately than
               any other creature in the world,—I was familiar with every detail of his outward life;
               could it be that in reality I did not know him at all?
               </p>
            
            
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>The drawing-room was already lighted with a flickering array of candles upon the mantelpiece
               and along the walls, producing the pretty, starry effect which candles give without
               very much light. As I had not the smallest idea what I was about to see, for <span class="character">Morphew’s</span> <span class="quote">“speaking likeness”</span> was very hurriedly said, and only half comprehensible in the bewilderment of my faculties,
               my first glance was at this very unusual illumination, for which I could assign no
               reason. The next showed me a large full-length portrait, still in the box in which
               apparently it had travelled, placed upright, supported against a table in the centre
               of the room. My father walked straight up to it, motioned to me to place a smaller
               table close to the picture on the left side, and put his lamp upon that. Then he waved
               his hand towards it, and stood aside that I might see.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>It was a full-length portrait of a very young woman—I might say a girl scarcely twenty—in
               a white dress, made in a very simple old fashion, though I was too little accustomed
               to female costume to be able to fix the date. It might have been a hundred years old,
               or twenty, for aught I knew. The face had an expression of youth, candor, and simplicity
               more than any face I had ever seen,—or so, at least in my surprise, I thought. The
               eyes were a little wistful, with something which was almost anxiety which at least
               was not content—in them; a faint, almost imperceptible, curve in the lids. The complexion
               was of a dazzling fairness, the hair light, but the eyes dark, which gave individuality
               to the face. It would have been as lovely had the eyes been blue,—probably more so,—but
               their darkness gave a touch of character, a slight discord, which made the harmony
               finer. It was not, perhaps, beautiful in the highest sense of the word. The girl must
               have been too young, too slight, too little developed for actual beauty; but a face
               which so invited love and confidence I never saw. One smiled at it with instinctive
               affection. <span class="quote">“What a sweet face!” I said. “What a lovely girl! Who is she? Is this one of the relations
                  you were speaking of on the other side?”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>My father made me no reply. He stood aside, looking at it as if he knew it too well
               to require to look,—as if the picture was already in his eyes. <span class="quote">“Yes,” he said, after an interval, with a long-drawn breath, “she was a lovely girl,
                  as you say.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Was?—then she is dead. What a pity!” I said; “what a pity! so young and so sweet!”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>We stood gazing at her thus, in her beautiful stillness and calm,—two men, the younger
               of us full-grown and conscious of many experiences, the other an old man,—before this
               impersonation of tender youth. At length he said, with a slight tremulousness in his
               voice, <span class="quote">“Does nothing suggest to you who she is, <span class="character">Phil</span>?”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>I turned round to look at him with profound astonishment, but he turned away from
               my look. A sort of quiver passed over his face. <span class="quote">“That is your mother,”</span> he said, and walked suddenly away, leaving me there.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>My mother!

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br>I stood for a moment in a kind of consternation before the white-robed innocent creature,
               to me no more than a child; then a sudden laugh broke from me, without any will of
               mine something ludicrous, as well as something awful, was in it. When the laugh was
               over, I found myself with tears in my eyes, gazing, holding my breath. The soft features
               seemed to melt, the lips to move, the anxiety in the eyes to become a personal inquiry.
               Ah, no! nothing of the kind; only because of the water in mine. My mother! oh, fair
               and gentle creature, scarcely woman, how could any man’s voice call her by that name!
               I had little idea enough of what it meant,—had heard it laughed at, scoffed at, reverenced,
               but never had learned to place it even among the ideal powers of life. Yet if it meant
               anything at all, what it meant was worth thinking of. What did she ask, looking at
               me with those eyes? What would she have said if “those lips had language”? If I had
               known her only as Cowper did—with a child’s recollection—there might have been some
               thread, some faint but comprehensible link, between us; but now all that I felt was
               the curious incongruity. Poor child! I said to myself; so sweet a creature: poor little
               tender soul! as if she had been a little sister, a child of mine,—but my mother! I
               cannot tell how long I stood looking at her, studying the candid, sweet face, which
               surely had germs in it of everything that was good and beautiful; and sorry, with
               a profound regret, that she had died and never carried these promises to fulfillment.
               Poor girl! poor people who had loved her! These were my thoughts; with a curious vertigo
               and giddiness of my whole being in the sense of a mysterious relationship, which it
               was beyond my power to understand.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>Presently my father came back, possibly because I had been a long time unconscious
               of the passage of the minutes, or perhaps because he was himself restless in the strange
               disturbance of his habitual calm. He came in and put his arm within mine, leaning
               his weight partially upon me, with an affectionate suggestion which went deeper than
               words. I pressed his arm to my side: it was more between us two grave Englishmen than
               any embracing.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“I cannot understand it,”</span> I said.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br><span class="quote">“No. I don’t wonder at that; but if it is strange to you, <span class="character">Phil</span>, think how much more strange to me! That is the partner of my life. I have never
                  had another, or thought of another. That—girl! If we are to meet again, as I have
                  always hoped we should meet again, what am I to say to her,—I, an old man? Yes; I
                  know what you mean. I am not an old man for my years; but my years are threescore
                  and ten, and the play is nearly played out. How am I to meet that young creature?
                  We used to say to each other that it was forever, that we never could be but one,
                  that it was for life and death. But what—what am I to say to her, <span class="character">Phil</span>, when I meet her again, that—that angel? No, it is not her being an angel that troubles
                  me; but she is so young! She is like my—my granddaughter,” he cried, with a burst
                  of what was half sobs, half laughter; “and she is my wife,—and I am an old man—an
                  old man! And so much has happened that she could not understand.”</span>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>I was too much startled by this strange complaint to know what to say. It was not
               my own trouble, and I answered it in the conventional way.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“They are not as we are, sir,” I said; “they look upon us with larger, other eyes

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br><span class="quote">“Ah! you don’t know what I mean,”</span> he said quickly; and in the interval he had subdued his emotion. <span class="quote">“At first, after she died, it was my consolation to think that I should meet her again,—that
                  we never could be really parted. But, my God, how I have changed since then! I am
                  another man,—I am a different being. I was not very young even then,—twenty years
                  older than she was; but her youth renewed mine. I was not an unfit partner; she asked
                  no better, and knew as much more than I did in some things,—being so much nearer the
                  source,—as I did in others that were of the world. But I have gone a long way since
                  then, <span class="character">Phil</span>,—a long way; and there she stands, just where I left her.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>I pressed his arm again. <span class="quote">“Father,”</span> I said, which was a title I seldom used, <span class="quote">“we are not to suppose that in a higher life the mind stands still.”</span> I did not feel myself qualified to discuss such topics, but something one must say.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br><span class="quote">“Worse, worse!”</span> he replied; <span class="quote">“then she too will be, like me, a different being, and we shall meet as what? as strangers,
                  as people who have lost sight of each other, with a long past between us,—we who parted,
                  my God! with—with—”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>His voice broke and ended for a moment then while, surprised and almost shocked by
               what he said, I cast about in my mind what to reply, he withdrew his arm suddenly
               from mine, and said in his usual tone, <span class="quote">“Where shall we hang the picture, <span class="character">Phil</span>? It must be here in this room. What do you think will be the best light?”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>This sudden alteration took me still more by surprise, and gave me almost an additional
               shock; but it was evident that I must follow the changes of his mood, or at least
               the sudden repression of sentiment which he originated. We went into that simpler
               question with great seriousness, consulting which would be the best light. <span class="quote">“You know I can scarcely advise,” I said; “I have never been familiar with this room.
                  I should like to put off, if you don’t mind, till daylight.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br><span class="quote">“I think,”</span> he said, <span class="quote">“that this would be the best place.”</span> It was on the other side of the fireplace, on the wall which faced the windows,—not
               the best light, I knew enough to be aware, for an oil-painting. When I said so, however,
               he answered me with a little impatience, “It does not matter very much about the best
               light; there will be nobody to see it but you and me. I have my reasons—” There was
               a small table standing against the wall at this spot, on which he had his hand as
               he spoke. Upon it stood a little basket in very fine lace-like wicker-work. His hand
               must have trembled, for the table shook, and the basket fell, its contents turning
               out upon the carpet,—little bits of needlework, colored silks, a small piece of knitting
               half done. He laughed as they rolled out at his feet, and tried to stoop to collect
               them, then tottered to a chair, and covered for a moment his face with his hands.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br>No need to ask what they were. No woman’s work had been seen in the house since I
               could recollect it. I gathered them up reverently and put them back. I could see,
               ignorant as I was, that the bit of knitting was something for an infant. What could
               I do less than put it to my lips? It had been left in the doing—for me.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Yes, I think this is the best place,”</span> my father said a minute after, in his usual tone.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>We placed it there that evening with our own hands. The picture was large, and in
               a heavy frame, but my father would let no one help me but himself. And then, with
               a superstition for which I never could give any reason even to myself, having removed
               the packings, we closed and locked the door, leaving the candles about the room, in
               their soft, strange illumination, lighting the first night of her return to her old
               place.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>That night no more was said. My father went to his room early, which was not his habit.
               He had never, however, accustomed me to sit late with him in the library. I had a
               little study or smoking-room of my own, in which all my special treasures were, the
               collections of my travels and my favorite books,—and where I always sat after prayers,
               a ceremonial which was regularly kept up in the house. I retired as usual this night
               to my room, and, as usual, read,—but to-night somewhat vaguely, often pausing to think.
               When it was quite late, I went out by the glass door to the lawn, and walked round
               the house, with the intention of looking in at the drawing-room windows, as I had
               done when a child. But I had forgotten that these windows were all shuttered at night;
               and nothing but a faint penetration of the light within through the crevices bore
               witness to the installment of the new dweller there.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br>In the morning my father was entirely himself again. He told me without emotion of
               the manner in which he had obtained the picture. It had belonged to my mother’s family,
               and had fallen eventually into the hands of a cousin of hers, resident abroad,—<span class="quote">“A man whom I did not like, and who did not like me,” my father said; “there was,
                  or had been, some rivalry, he thought: a mistake, but he was never aware of that.
                  He refused all my requests to have a copy made. You may suppose, <span class="character">Phil</span>, that I wished this very much. Had I succeeded, you would have been acquainted, at
                  least, with your mother’s appearance, and need not have sustained this shock. But
                  he would not consent. It gave him, I think, a certain pleasure to think that he had
                  the only picture. But now he is dead, and out of remorse, or with some other intention,
                  has left it to me.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: optimism]</span><br><span class="quote">“That looks like kindness,”</span> said I.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Yes; or something else. He might have thought that by so doing he was establishing
                  a claim upon me,”</span> my father said; but he did not seem disposed to add any more. On whose behalf he
               meant to establish a claim I did not know, nor who the man was who had laid us under
               so great an obligation on his death-bed. He had established a claim on me at least;
               though, as he was dead, I could not see on whose behalf it was. And my father said
               nothing more; he seemed to dislike the subject. When I attempted to return to it,
               he had recourse to his letters or his newspapers. Evidently he had made up his mind
               to say no more.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br>Afterwards I went into the drawing-room, to look at the picture once more. It seemed
               to me that the anxiety in her eyes was not so evident as I had thought it last night.
               The light possibly was more favorable. She stood just above the place where, I make
               no doubt, she had sat in life, where her little work-basket was,—not very much above
               it. The picture was full-length, and we had hung it low, so that she might have been
               stepping into the room, and was little above my own level as I stood and looked at
               her again. Once more I smiled at the strange thought that this young creature—so young,
               almost childish—could be my mother; and once more my eyes grew wet looking at her.
               He was a benefactor, indeed, who had given her back to us. I said to myself, that
               if I could ever do anything for him or his, I would certainly do it, for my—for this
               lovely young creature’s sake. And with this in my mind, and all the thoughts that
               came with it, I am obliged to confess that the other matter, which I had been so full
               of on the previous night, went entirely out of my head.
               </p>
            
            
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>It is rarely, however, that such matters are allowed to slip out of one’s mind. When
               I went out in the afternoon for my usual stroll,—or rather when I returned from that
               stroll,—I saw once more before me the woman with her baby, whose story had filled
               me with dismay on the previous evening. She was waiting at the gate as before, and,
               <span class="quote">“Oh, gentleman, but haven’t you got some news to give me?” she said.</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“My good woman,—I—have been greatly occupied. I have had—no time to do anything.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Ah!” she said, with a little cry of disappointment, “my man said not to make too
                  sure, and that the ways of the gentlefolks is hard to know.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“I cannot explain to you,” I said, as gently as I could, “what it is that has made
                  me forget you. It was an event that can only do you good in the end. Go home now,
                  and see the man that took your things from you, and tell him to come to me. I promise
                  you it shall all be put right.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: optimism]</span><br>The woman looked at me in astonishment, then burst forth, as it seemed, involuntarily,
               <span class="quote">“What! without asking no questions?”</span> After this there came a storm of tears and blessings, from which I made haste to
               escape, but not without carrying that curious commentary on my rashness away with
               me,—“Without asking no questions?” It might be foolish, perhaps; but after all, how
               slight a matter. To make the poor creature comfortable at the cost of what,—a box
               or two of cigars, perhaps, or some other trifle. And if it should be her own fault,
               or her husband’s—what then? Had I been punished for all my faults, where should I
               have been now? And if the advantage should be only temporary, what then? To be relieved
               and comforted even for a day or two, was not that something to count in life? Thus
               I quenched the fiery dart of criticism which my protégée herself had thrown into the
               transaction, not without a certain sense of the humor of it. Its effect, however,
               was to make me less anxious to see my father, to repeat my proposal to him, and to
               call his attention to the cruelty performed in his name. This one case I had taken
               out of the category of wrongs to be righted, by assuming arbitrarily the position
               of Providence in my own person,—for, of course, I had bound myself to pay the poor
               creature’s rent as well as redeem her goods,—and, whatever might happen to her in
               the future, had taken the past into my own hands. The man came presently to see me,
               who, it seems, had acted as my father’s agent in the matter. <span class="quote">“I don’t know, sir, how <span class="character">Mr. Canning</span> will take it,” he said. “He don’t want none of those irregular, bad-paying ones in
                  his property. He always says as to look over it and let the rent run on is making
                  things worse in the end. His rule is, ‘Never more than a month, <span class="character">Stevens</span>;’ that’s what <span class="character">Mr. Canning</span> says to me, sir. He says, ‘More than that they can’t pay. It’s no use trying.’ And
                  it’s a good rule; it’s a very good rule. He won’t hear none of their stories, sir.
                  Bless you, you’d never get a penny of rent from them small houses if you listened
                  to their tales. But if so be as you’ll pay <span class="character">Mrs. Jordan’s</span> rent, it’s none of my business how it’s paid, so long as it’s paid, and I’ll send
                  her back her things. But they’ll just have to be took next time,” he added composedly.
                  “Over and over; it’s always the same story with them sort of poor folks,—they’re too
                  poor for anything, that’s the truth,”</span> the man said.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="character">Morphew</span> came back to my room after my visitor was gone. <span class="quote">“<span class="character">Mr. Philip</span>,” he said, “you’ll excuse me, sir, but if you’re going to pay all the poor folks’
                  rent as have distresses put in, you may just go into the court at once, for it’s without

               It was a very mild spring evening, and he made up a great blaze which would have suited
               December. This is one of many ways in which an old servant will relieve his mind.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: cynical]</span><br>I retired to my room greatly discouraged that night. In former ages—or so one is led
               to suppose—and in the lower primitive classes who still linger near the primeval type,
               action of any kind was, and is, easier than amid the complication of our higher civilization.
               A bad man is a distinct entity, against whom you know more or less what steps to take.
               A tyrant, an oppressor, a bad landlord, a man who lets miserable tenements at a rack-rent
               (to come down to particulars), and exposes his wretched tenants to all those abominations
               of which we have heard so much—well! he is more or less a satisfactory opponent. There
               he is, and there is nothing to be said for him—down with him! and let there be an
               end of his wickedness. But when, on the contrary, you have before you a good man,
               a just man, who has considered deeply a question which you allow to be full of difficulty;
               who regrets, but cannot, being human, avert the miseries which to some unhappy individuals
               follow from the very wisdom of his rule,—what can you do? What is to be done? Individual
               benevolence at haphazard may balk him here and there, but what have you to put in
               the place of his well-considered scheme? Charity which makes paupers? or what else?
               I had not considered the question deeply, but it seemed to me that I now came to a
               blank wall, which my vague human sentiment of pity and scorn could find no way to
               breach. There must be wrong somewhere, but where? There must be some change for the
               better to be made, but how?
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>I was seated with a book before me on the table, with my head supported on my hands.
               My eyes were on the printed page, but I was not reading; my mind was full of these
               thoughts, my heart of great discouragement and despondency,—a sense that I could do
               nothing, yet that there surely must and ought, if I but knew it, be something to do.
               The fire which <span class="character">Morphew</span> had built up before dinner was dying out, the shaded lamp on my table left all the
               corners in a mysterious twilight. The house was perfectly still, no one moving: my
               father in the library, where, after the habit of many solitary years, he liked to
               be left alone, and I here in my retreat, preparing for the formation of similar habits.
               I thought all at once of the third member of the party, the new-comer, alone too in
               the room that had been hers; and there suddenly occurred to me a strong desire to
               take up my lamp and go to the drawing-room and visit her, to see whether her soft,
               angelic face would give any inspiration. I restrained, however, this futile impulse,—for
               what could the picture say?—and instead wondered what might have been had she lived,
               had she been there, warmly enthroned beside the warm domestic centre, the hearth which
               would have been a common sanctuary, the true home. In that case what might have been?
               Alas! the question was no more simple to answer than the other: she might have been
               there alone too, her husband’s business, her son’s thoughts, as far from her as now,
               when her silent representative held her old place in the silence and darkness. I had
               known it so, often enough. Love itself does not always give comprehension and sympathy.
               It might be that she was more to us there, in the sweet image of her undeveloped beauty,
               than she might have been had she lived and grown to maturity and fading, like the
               rest.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: fear]</span><br>I cannot be certain whether my mind was still lingering on this not very cheerful
               reflection, or if it had been left behind, when the strange occurrence came of which
               I have now to tell. Can I call it an occurrence? My eyes were on my book, when I thought
               I heard the sound of a door opening and shutting, but so far away and faint that if
               real at all it must have been in a far corner of the house. I did not move except
               to lift my eyes from the book as one does instinctively the better to listen; when—But
               I cannot tell, nor have I ever been able to describe exactly what it was. My heart
               made all at once a sudden leap in my breast. I am aware that this language is figurative,
               and that the heart cannot leap; but it is a figure so entirely justified by sensation,
               that no one will have any difficulty in understanding what I mean. My heart leaped
               up and began beating wildly in my throat, in my ears, as if my whole being had received
               a sudden and intolerable shock. The sound went through my head like the dizzy sound
               of some strange mechanism, a thousand wheels and springs circling, echoing, working
               in my brain. I felt the blood bound in my veins, my mouth became dry, my eyes hot;
               a sense of something insupportable took possession of me. I sprang to my feet, and
               then I sat down again. I cast a quick glance round me beyond the brief circle of the
               lamplight, but there was nothing there to account in any way for this sudden extraordinary
               rush of sensation, nor could I feel any meaning in it, any suggestion, any moral impression.
               I thought I must be going to be ill, and got out my watch and felt my pulse: it was
               beating furiously, about one hundred and twenty-five throbs in a minute. I knew of
               no illness that could come on like this without warning, in a moment, and I tried
               to subdue myself, to say to myself that it was nothing, some flutter of the nerves,
               some physical disturbance. I laid myself down upon my sofa to try if rest would help
               me, and kept still, as long as the thumping and throbbing of this wild, excited mechanism
               within, like a wild beast plunging and struggling, would let me. I am quite aware
               of the confusion of the metaphor; the reality was just so. It was like a mechanism
               deranged, going wildly with ever-increasing precipitation, like those horrible wheels
               that from time to time catch a helpless human being in them and tear him to pieces;
               but at the same time it was like a maddened living creature making the wildest efforts
               to get free.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>When I could bear this no longer I got up and walked about my room; then having still
               a certain command of myself, though I could not master the commotion within me, I
               deliberately took down an exciting book from the shelf, a book of breathless adventure
               which had always interested me, and tried with that to break the spell. After a few
               minutes, however, I flung the book aside; I was gradually losing all power over myself.
               What I should be moved to do,—to shout aloud, to struggle with I know not what; or
               if I was going mad altogether, and next moment must be a raving lunatic,—I could not
               tell. I kept looking round, expecting I don’t know what; several times with the corner
               of my eye I seemed to see a movement, as if some one was stealing out of sight; but
               when I looked straight, there was never anything but the plain outlines of the wall
               and carpet, the chairs standing in good order. At last I snatched up the lamp in my
               hand, and went out of the room. To look at the picture, which had been faintly showing
               in my imagination from time to time, the eyes, more anxious than ever, looking at
               me from out the silent air? But no; I passed the door of that room swiftly, moving,
               it seemed, without any volition of my own, and before I knew where I was going, went
               into my father’s library with my lamp in my hand.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: fear]</span><br>He was still sitting there at his writing-table; he looked up astonished to see me
               hurrying in with my light. <span class="quote">“<span class="character">Phil</span>!”</span> he said, surprised. I remember that I shut the door behind me, and came up to him,
               and set down the lamp on his table. My sudden appearance alarmed him. <span class="quote">“What is the matter?” he cried. “<span class="character">Philip</span>, what have you been doing with yourself?”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: fear]</span><br>I sat down on the nearest chair and gasped, gazing at him. The wild commotion ceased;
               the blood subsided into its natural channels; my heart resumed its place. I use such
               words as mortal weakness can to express the sensations I felt. I came to myself thus,
               gazing at him, confounded, at once by the extraordinary passion which I had gone through,
               and its sudden cessation. <span class="quote">“The matter?” I cried; “I don’t know what is the matter.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>My father had pushed his spectacles up from his eyes. He appeared to me as faces appear
               in a fever, all glorified with light which is not in them,—his eyes glowing, his white
               hair shining like silver; but his looks were severe. <span class="quote">“You are not a boy, that I should reprove you; but you ought to know better,”</span> he said.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>Then I explained to him, so far as I was able, what had happened. Had happened? Nothing
               had happened. He did not understand me; nor did I, now that it was over, understand
               myself; but he saw enough to make him aware that the disturbance in me was serious,
               and not caused by any folly of my own. He was very kind as soon as he had assured
               himself of this, and talked, taking pains to bring me back to unexciting subjects.
               He had a letter in his hand with a very deep border of black when I came in. I observed
               it, without taking any notice or associating it with anything I knew. He had many
               correspondents; and although we were excellent friends, we had never been on those
               confidential terms which warrant one man in asking another from whom a special letter
               has come. We were not so near to each other as this, though we were father and son.
               After a while I went back to my own room, and finished the evening in my usual way,
               without any return of the excitement which, now that it was over, looked to me like
               some extraordinary dream. What had it meant? Had it meant anything? I said to myself
               that it must be purely physical, something gone temporarily amiss, which had righted
               itself. It was physical; the excitement did not affect my mind. I was independent
               of it all the time, a spectator of my own agitation, a clear proof that, whatever
               it was, it had affected my bodily organization alone.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>Next day I returned to the problem which I had not been able to solve. I found out
               my petitioner in the back street, and that she was happy in the recovery of her possessions,
               which to my eyes indeed did not seem very worthy either of lamentation or delight.
               Nor was her house the tidy house which injured virtue should have when restored to
               its humble rights. She was not injured virtue, it was clear. She made me a great many
               curtseys, and poured forth a number of blessings. Her “man” came in while I was there,
               and hoped in a gruff voice that God would reward me, and that the old gentleman’d
               let ’em alone. I did not like the look of the man. It seemed to me that in the dark
               lane behind the house of a winter’s night he would not be a pleasant person to find
               in one’s way. Nor was this all: when I went out into the little street which it appeared
               was all, or almost all, my father’s property, a number of groups formed in my way,
               and at least half-a-dozen applicants sidled up. <span class="quote">“I’ve more claims nor <span class="character">Mary Jordan</span> any day,” said one; “I’ve lived on <span class="character">Squire Canning’s</span> property, one place and another, this twenty year.”</span> <span class="quote">“And what do you say to me?” said another; “I’ve six children to her two, bless you,
                  sir, and ne’er a father to do for them.”</span> I believed in my father’s rule before I got out of the street, and approved his wisdom
               in keeping himself free from personal contact with his tenants. Yet when I looked
               back upon the swarming thoroughfare, the mean little houses, the women at their doors
               all so open-mouthed and eager to contend for my favor, my heart sank within me at
               the thought that out of their misery some portion of our wealth came, I don’t care
               how small a portion; that I, young and strong, should be kept idle and in luxury,
               in some part through the money screwed out of their necessities, obtained sometimes
               by the sacrifice of everything they prized! Of course I know all the ordinary commonplaces
               of life as well as any one,—that if you build a house with your hand or your money,
               and let it, the rent of it is your just due; and must be paid. But yet—
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Don’t you think, sir,”</span> I said that evening at dinner, the subject being reintroduced by my father himself,
               <span class="quote">“that we have some duty towards them when we draw so much from them?”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“Certainly,” he said; “I take as much trouble about their drains as I do about my
                  own.”</span>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“That is always something, I suppose.”</span>

                  clean, as far as that’s possible. I give them at least the means of keeping clean,
                  and thus check disease, and prolong life, which is more, I assure you, than they’ve
                  any right to expect.”</span>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>I was not prepared with arguments as I ought to have been. That is all in the Gospel
               according to <span class="character">Adam Smith</span>, which my father had been brought up in, but of which the tenets had begun to be
               less binding in my day. I wanted something more, or else something less; but my views
               were not so clear, nor my system so logical and well-built, as that upon which my
               father rested his conscience, and drew his percentage with a light heart.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>Yet I thought there were signs in him of some perturbation. I met him one morning
               coming out of the room in which the portrait hung, as if he had gone to look at it
               stealthily. He was shaking his head, and saying <span class="quote">“No, no,”</span> to himself, not perceiving me, and I stepped aside when I saw him so absorbed. For
               myself, I entered that room but little. I went outside, as I had so often done when
               I was a child, and looked through the windows into the still and now sacred place,
               which had always impressed me with a certain awe. Looked at so, the slight figure
               in its white dress seemed to be stepping down into the room from some slight visionary
               altitude, looking with that which had seemed to me at first anxiety, which I sometimes
               represented to myself now as a wistful curiosity, as if she were looking for the life
               which might have been hers. Where was the existence that had belonged to her, the
               sweet household place, the infant she had left? She would no more recognize the man
               who thus came to look at her as through a veil, with a mystic reverence, than I could
               recognize her. I could never be her child to her, any more than she could be a mother
               to me.
               </p>
            
            
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>Thus time passed on for several quiet days. There was nothing to make us give any
               special heed to the passage of time, life being very uneventful and its habits unvaried.
               My mind was very much preoccupied by my father’s tenants. He had a great deal of property
               in the town which was so near us,—streets of small houses, the best-paying property
               (I was assured) of any. I was very anxious to come to some settled conclusion: on
               the one hand, not to let myself be carried away by sentiment; on the other, not to
               allow my strongly roused feelings to fall into the blank of routine, as his had done.
               I was seated one evening in my own sitting-room, busy with this matter,—busy with
               calculations as to cost and profit, with an anxious desire to convince him, either
               that his profits were greater than justice allowed, or that they carried with them
               a more urgent duty than he had conceived.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: fear]</span><br>It was night, but not late, not more than ten o’clock, the household still astir.
               Everything was quiet,—not the solemnity of midnight silence, in which there is always
               something of mystery, but the soft-breathing quiet of the evening, full of the faint
               habitual sounds of a human dwelling, a consciousness of life about. And I was very
               busy with my figures, interested, feeling no room in my mind for any other thought.
               The singular experience which had startled me so much had passed over very quickly,
               and there had been no return. I had ceased to think of it; indeed, I had never thought
               of it save for the moment, setting it down after it was over to a physical cause without
               much difficulty. At this time I was far too busy to have thoughts to spare for anything,
               or room for imagination; and when suddenly in a moment, without any warning, the first
               symptom returned, I started with it into determined resistance, resolute not to be
               fooled by any mock influence which could resolve itself into the action of nerves
               or ganglions. The first symptom; as before, was that my heart sprang up with a bound,
               as if a cannon had been fired at my ear. My whole being responded with a start. The
               pen fell out of my fingers, the figures went out of my head as if all faculty had
               departed; and yet I was conscious for a time at least of keeping my self-control.
               I was like the rider of a frightened horse, rendered almost wild by something which
               in the mystery of its voiceless being it has seen, something on the road which it
               will not pass, but wildly plunging, resisting every persuasion, turns from, with ever-increasing
               passion. The rider himself after a time becomes infected with this inexplainable desperation
               of terror, and I suppose I must have done so; but for a time I kept the upper hand.
               I would not allow myself to spring up as I wished, as my impulse was, but sat there
               doggedly, clinging to my books, to my table, fixing myself on I did not mind what,
               to resist the flood of sensation, of emotion, which was sweeping through me, carrying
               me away. I tried to continue my calculations. I tried to stir myself up with recollections
               of the miserable sights I had seen, the poverty, the helplessness. I tried to work
               myself into indignation; but all through these efforts I felt the contagion growing
               upon me, my mind falling into sympathy with all those straining faculties of the body,
               startled, excited, driven wild by something, I knew not what. It was not fear. I was
               like a ship at sea straining and plunging against wind and tide, but I was not afraid.
               I am obliged to use these metaphors, otherwise I could give no explanation of my condition,
               seized upon against my will, and torn from all those moorings of reason to which I
               clung with desperation, as long as I had the strength.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>When I got up from my chair at last, the battle was lost, so far as my powers of self-control
               were concerned. I got up, or rather was dragged up, from my seat, clutching at these
               material things round me as with a last effort to hold my own. But that was no longer
               possible; I was overcome. I stood for a moment looking round me feebly, feeling myself
               begin to babble with stammering lips, which was the alternative of shrieking, and
               which I seemed to choose as a lesser evil. What I said was, <span class="quote">“What am I to do?”</span> and after a while, <span class="quote">“What do you want me to do?”</span> although throughout I saw no one, heard no voice, and had in reality not power enough
               in my dizzy and confused brain to know what I myself meant. I stood thus for a moment,
               looking blankly round me for guidance, repeating the question, which seemed after
               a time to become almost mechanical, <span class="quote">“What do you want me to do?”</span> though I neither knew to whom I addressed it nor why I said it. Presently—whether
               in answer, whether in mere yielding of nature, I cannot tell—I became aware of a difference:
               not a lessening of the agitation, but a softening, as if my powers of resistance being
               exhausted, a gentler force, a more benignant influence, had room. I felt myself consent
               to whatever it was. My heart melted in the midst of the tumult; I seemed to give myself
               up, and move as if drawn by some one whose arm was in mine, as if softly swept along,
               not forcibly, but with an utter consent of all my faculties to do I knew not what,
               for love of I knew not whom. For love,—that was how it seemed,—not by force, as when
               I went before. But my steps took the same course: I went through the dim passages
               in an exaltation indescribable, and opened the door of my father’s room.

               hair; he looked up with some surprise at the sound of the opening door. <span class="quote">“<span class="character">Phil</span>,”</span> he said, and with a look of wondering apprehension on his face, watched my approach.
               I went straight up to him and put my hand on his shoulder. <span class="quote">“<span class="character">Phil</span>, what is the matter? What do you want with me? What is it?”</span> he said.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>I stood with my hand upon the back of his chair. His table was covered with papers,
               among which were several letters with the broad black border which I had before observed.
               I noticed this now in my excitement without any distinct association of thoughts,
               for that I was not capable of; but the black border caught my eye. And I was conscious
               that he too gave a hurried glance at them, and with one hand swept them away.

                  tell; but there is some cause for it. You are doing something or planning something
                  with which I have a right to interfere.”</span>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>He turned round squarely in his chair, with a spark in his blue eyes. He was not a
               man to be meddled with. <span class="quote">“I have yet to learn what can give my son a right to interfere. I am in possession
                  of all my faculties, I hope.”</span>

                  this is different. I am not here by my own will. Something that is stronger than I
                  has brought me. There is something in your mind which disturbs—others. I don’t know
                  what I am saying. This is not what I meant to say; but you know the meaning better
                  than I. Some one—who can speak to you only by me—speaks to you by me; and I know that

               my message was delivered. My heart sank into a stillness so sudden that it made me
               faint. The light swam in my eyes; everything went round with me. I kept upright only
               by my hold upon the chair; and in the sense of utter weakness that followed, I dropped
               on my knees I think first, then on the nearest seat that presented itself, and, covering
               my face with my hands, had hard ado not to sob, in the sudden removal of that strange
               influence,—the relaxation of the strain.

               or in reality, always keeping uppermost. I went to my own room for my lamp, and then
               alone proceeded to the silent shrine in which the portrait hung. I at least would
               look at her to-night. I don’t know whether I asked myself, in so many words, if it
               were she who—or if it was any one—I knew nothing; but my heart was drawn with a softness—born,
               perhaps, of the great weakness in which I was left after that visitation—to her, to
               look at her, to see, perhaps, if there was any sympathy, any approval in her face.
               I set down my lamp on the table where her little work-basket still was; the light
               threw a gleam upward upon her,—she seemed more than ever to be stepping into the room,
               coming down towards me, coming back to her life. Ah, no! her life was lost and vanished:
               all mine stood between her and the days she knew. She looked at me with eyes that
               did not change. The anxiety I had seen at first seemed now a wistful, subdued question;
               but that difference was not in her look but in mine.
               </p>
            
            
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>I need not linger on the intervening time. The doctor who attended us usually, came
               in next day <span class="quote">“by accident,”</span> and we had a long conversation. On the following day a very impressive yet genial
               gentleman from town lunched with us,—a friend of my father’s, Dr. Something; but the
               introduction was hurried, and I did not catch his name. He, too, had a long talk with
               me afterwards, my father being called away to speak to some one on business. Dr.——
               drew me out on the subject of the dwellings of the poor. He said he heard I took great
               interest in this question, which had come so much to the front at the present moment.
               He was interested in it too, and wanted to know the view I took. I explained at considerable
               length that my view did not concern the general subject, on which I had scarcely thought,
               so much as the individual mode of management of my father’s estate. He was a most
               patient and intelligent listener, agreeing with me on some points, differing in others;
               and his visit was very pleasant. I had no idea until after of its special object;
               though a certain puzzled look and slight shake of the head when my father returned,
               might have thrown some light upon it. The report of the medical experts in my case
               must, however, have been quite satisfactory, for I heard nothing more of them. It
               was, I think, a fortnight later when the next and last of these strange experiences
               came.

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>This time it was morning, about noon,—a wet and rather dismal spring day. The half-spread
               leaves seemed to tap at the window, with an appeal to be taken in; the primroses,
               that showed golden upon the grass at the roots of the trees, just beyond the smooth-shorn
               grass of the lawn, were all drooped and sodden among their sheltering leaves. The
               very growth seemed dreary—the sense of spring in the air making the feeling of winter
               a grievance, instead of the natural effect which it had conveyed a few months before.
               I had been writing letters, and was cheerful enough, going back among the associates
               of my old life, with, perhaps, a little longing for its freedom and independence,
               but at the same time a not ungrateful consciousness that for the moment my present
               tranquillity might be best.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: fear]</span><br>This was my condition—a not unpleasant one—when suddenly the now well-known symptoms
               of the visitation to which I had become subject suddenly seized upon me,—the leap
               of the heart; the sudden, causeless, overwhelming physical excitement, which I could
               neither ignore nor allay. I was terrified beyond description, beyond reason, when
               I became conscious that this was about to begin over again: what purpose did it answer;
               what good was in it? My father indeed understood the meaning of it though I did not
               understand; but it was little agreeable to be thus made a helpless instrument, without
               any will of mine, in an operation of which I knew nothing; and to enact the part of
               the oracle unwillingly, with suffering and such a strain as it took me days to get
               over. I resisted, not as before, but yet desperately, trying with better knowledge
               to keep down the growing passion. I hurried to my room and swallowed a dose of a sedative
               which had been given me to procure sleep on my first return from <span class="place">India</span>. I saw <span class="character">Morphew</span> in the hall, and called him to talk to him, and cheat myself, if possible, by that
               means. <span class="character">Morphew</span> lingered, however, and, before he came, I was beyond conversation. I heard him speak,
               his voice coming vaguely through the turmoil which was already in my ears, but what
               he said I have never known. I stood staring, trying to recover my power of attention,
               with an aspect which ended by completely frightening the man. He cried out at last
               that he was sure I was ill, that he must bring me something; which words penetrated
               more or less into my maddened brain. It became impressed upon me that he was going
               to get some one—one of my father’s doctors, perhaps—to prevent me from acting, to
               stop my interference, and that if I waited a moment longer I might be too late. A
               vague idea seized me at the same time, of taking refuge with the portrait,—going to
               its feet, throwing myself there, perhaps, till the paroxysm should be over. But it
               was not there that my footsteps were directed. I can remember making an effort to
               open the door of the drawing-room, and feeling myself swept past it, as if by a gale
               of wind. It was not there that I had to go. I knew very well where I had to go,—once
               more on my confused and voiceless mission to my father, who understood, although I
               could not understand.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>Yet as it was daylight, and all was clear, I could not help noting one or two circumstances
               on my way. I saw some one sitting in the hall as if waiting,—a woman, a girl, a black-shrouded
               figure, with a thick veil over her face; and asked myself who she was, and what she
               wanted there. This question, which had nothing to do with my present condition, somehow
               got into my mind, and was tossed up and down upon the tumultuous tide like a stray
               log on the breast of a fiercely rolling stream, now submerged, now coming uppermost,
               at the mercy of the waters. It did not stop me for a moment, as I hurried towards
               my father’s room, but it got upon the current of my mind. I flung open my father’s
               door, and closed it again after me, without seeing who was there or how he was engaged.
               The full clearness of the daylight did not identify him as the lamp did at night.
               He looked up at the sound of the door, with a glance of apprehension; and rising suddenly,
               interrupting some one who was standing speaking to him with much earnestness and even
               vehemence, came forward to meet me. <span class="quote">“I cannot be disturbed at present,” he said quickly; “I am busy.”</span> Then seeing the look in my face, which by this time he knew, he too changed color.
               <span class="quote">“<span class="character">Phil</span>,” he said, in a low, imperative voice, “wretched boy, go away—go away; don’t let
                  a stranger see you—”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br><span class="quote">“I can’t go away,” I said. “It is impossible. You know why I have come. I cannot,
                  if I would. It is more powerful than I—”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: anger]</span><br><span class="quote">“Go, sir,” he said; “go at once; no more of this folly. I will not have you in this
                  room: Go-go!”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>I made no answer. I don’t know that I could have done so. There had never been any
               struggle between us before; but I had no power to do one thing or another. The tumult
               within me was in full career. I heard indeed what he said, and was able to reply;
               but his words, too, were like straws tossed upon the tremendous stream. I saw now
               with my feverish eyes who the other person present was. It was a woman, dressed also
               in mourning similar to the one in the hall; but this a middle-aged woman, like a respectable
               servant. She had been crying, and in the pause caused by this encounter between my
               father and myself, dried her eyes with a handkerchief, which she rolled like a ball
               in her hand, evidently in strong emotion. She turned and looked at me as my father
               spoke to me, for a moment with a gleam of hope, then falling back into her former
               attitude.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>My father returned to his seat. He was much agitated too, though doing all that was
               possible to conceal it. My inopportune arrival was evidently a great and unlooked-for
               vexation to him. He gave me the only look of passionate displeasure I have ever had
               from him, as he sat down again; but he said nothing more.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br><span class="quote">“You must understand,” he said, addressing the woman, “that I have said my last words
                  on this subject. I don’t choose to enter into it again in the presence of my son,
                  who is not well enough to be made a party to any discussion. I am sorry that you should
                  have had so much trouble in vain, but you were warned beforehand, and you have only
                  yourself to blame. I acknowledge no claim, and nothing you can say will change my
                  resolution. I must beg you to go away. All this is very painful and quite useless.
                  I acknowledge no claim.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: sadness]</span><br><span class="quote">“Oh, sir,”</span> she cried, her eyes beginning once more to flow, her speech interrupted by little
               sobs. <span class="quote">“Maybe I did wrong to speak of a claim. I’m not educated to argue with a gentleman.
                  Maybe we have no claim. But if it’s not by right, oh, <span class="character">Mr. Canning</span>, won’t you let your heart be touched by pity? She don’t know what I’m saying, poor
                  dear. She’s not one to beg and pray for herself, as I’m doing for her. Oh, sir, she’s
                  so young! She’s so lone in this world,—not a friend to stand by her, nor a house to
                  take her in! You are the nearest to her of any one that’s left in this world. She
                  hasn’t a relation,—not one so near as you,—oh!”</span> she cried, with a sudden thought, turning quickly round upon me, <span class="quote">“this gentleman’s your son! Now I think of it, it’s not your relation she is, but
                  his, through his mother! That’s nearer, nearer! Oh, sir! you’re young; your heart
                  should be more tender. Here is my young lady that has no one in the world to look
                  to her. Your own flesh and blood; your mother’s cousin,—your mother’s—”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>My father called to her to stop, with a voice of thunder. <span class="quote">“<span class="character">Philip</span>, leave us at once. It is not a matter to be discussed with you.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: optimism]</span><br>And then in a moment it became clear to me what it was. It had been with difficulty
               that I had kept myself still. My breast was laboring with the fever of an impulse
               poured into me, more than I could contain. And now for the first time I knew why.
               I hurried towards him, and took his hand, though he resisted, into mine. Mine were
               burning, but his like ice: their touch burnt me with its chill, like fire. <span class="quote">“This is what it is?” I cried. “I had no knowledge before. I don’t know now what is
                  being asked of you. But, father, understand! You know, and I know now, that some one
                  sends me,—some one—who has a right to interfere.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: anger]</span><br>He pushed me away with all his might. <span class="quote">“You are mad,” he cried. “What right have you to think—? Oh, you are mad—mad! I have
                  seen it coming on—”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>The woman, the petitioner, had grown silent, watching this brief conflict with the
               terror and interest with which women watch a struggle between men. She started and
               fell back when she heard what he said, but did not take her eyes off me, following
               every movement I made. When I turned to go away, a cry of indescribable disappointment
               and remonstrance burst from her, and even my father raised himself up and stared at
               my withdrawal, astonished to find that he had overcome me so soon and easily. I paused
               for a moment, and looked back on them, seeing them large and vague through the mist
               of fever. <span class="quote">“I am not going away,” I said. “I am going for another messenger,—one you can’t gainsay.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: anger]</span><br>My father rose. He called out to me threateningly, <span class="quote">“I will have nothing touched that is hers. Nothing that is hers shall be profaned—”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>I waited to hear no more; I knew what I had to do. By what means it was conveyed to
               me I cannot tell; but the certainty of an influence which no one thought of calmed
               me in the midst of my fever. I went out into the hall, where I had seen the young
               stranger waiting. I went up to her and touched her on the shoulder. She rose at once,
               with a little movement of alarm, yet with docile and instant obedience, as if she
               had expected the summons. I made her take off her veil and her bonnet, scarcely looking
               at her, scarcely seeing her, knowing how it was: I took her soft, small, cool, yet
               trembling hand into mine; it was so soft and cool,—not cold,—it refreshed me with
               its tremulous touch. All through I moved and spoke like a man in a dream; swiftly,
               noiselessly, all the complications of waking life removed; without embarrassment,
               without reflection, without the loss of a moment. My father was still standing up,
               leaning a little forward as he had done when I withdrew; threatening, yet terror-stricken,
               not knowing what I might be about to do, when I returned with my companion. That was
               the one thing he had not thought of. He was entirely undecided, unprepared. He gave
               her one look, flung up his arms above his head, and uttered a distracted cry, so wild
               that it seemed the last outcry of nature,—<span class="quote">“<span class="character">Agnes</span>!”</span> then fell back like a sudden ruin, upon himself, into his chair.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>I had no leisure to think how he was, or whether he could hear what I said. I had
               my message to deliver. <span class="quote">“Father,”</span> I said, laboring with my panting breath, <span class="quote">“it is for this that heaven has opened, and one whom I never saw, one whom I know
                  not, has taken possession of me. Had we been less earthly, we should have seen her—herself,
                  and not merely her image. I have not even known what she meant. I have been as a fool
                  without understanding. This is the third time I have come to you with her message,
                  without knowing what to say. But now I have found it out. This is her message. I have
                  found it out at last.”</span> There was an awful pause,—a pause in which no one moved or breathed. Then there came
               a broken voice out of my father’s chair. He had not understood, though I think he
               heard what I said. He put out two feeble hands. <span class="quote">“<span class="character">Phil</span>—I think I am dying—has she—has she come for me?”</span> he said.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>We had to carry him to his bed. What struggles he had gone through before I cannot
               tell. He had stood fast, and had refused to be moved, and now he fell,—like an old
               tower, like an old tree. The necessity there was for thinking of him saved me from
               the physical consequences which had prostrated me on a former occasion. I had no leisure
               now for any consciousness of how matters went with myself.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br>His delusion was not wonderful, but most natural. She was clothed in black from head
               to foot, instead of the white dress of the portrait. She had no knowledge of the conflict,
               of nothing but that she was called for, that her fate might depend on the next few
               minutes. In her eyes there was a pathetic question, a line of anxiety in the lids,
               an innocent appeal in the looks. And the face the same: the same lips, sensitive,
               ready to quiver; the same innocent, candid brow; the look of a common race, which
               is more subtle than mere resemblance. How I knew that it was so I cannot tell, nor
               any man. It was the other, the elder,—ah, no! not elder; the ever young, the <span class="character">Agnes</span> to whom age can never come, she who they say was the mother of a man who never saw
               her,—it was she who led her kinswoman, her representative, into our hearts.
               </p>
            
            
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br>My father recovered after a few days: he had taken cold, it was said, the day before;
               and naturally, at seventy, a small matter is enough to upset the balance even of a
               strong man. He got quite well; but he was willing enough afterwards to leave the management
               of that ticklish kind of property which involves human well-being in my hands, who
               could move about more freely, and see with my own eyes how things were going on. He
               liked home better, and had more pleasure in his personal existence in the end of his
               life. <span class="character">Agnes</span> is now my wife, as he had, of course, foreseen. It was not merely the disinclination
               to receive her father’s daughter, or to take upon him a new responsibility, that had
               moved him, to do him justice; but both these motives had told strongly. I have never
               been told, and now will never be told, what his griefs against my mother’s family,
               and specially against that cousin, had been; but that he had been very determined,
               deeply prejudiced, there can be no doubt. It turned out after, that the first occasion
               on which I had been mysteriously commissioned to him with a message which I did not
               understand, and which for that time he did not understand, was the evening of the
               day on which he had received the dead man’s letter, appealing to him—to him, a man
               whom he had wronged—on behalf of the child who was about to be left friendless in
               the world. The second time, further letters—from the nurse who was the only guardian
               of the orphan, and the chaplain of the place where her father had died, taking it
               for granted that my father’s house was her natural refuge—had been received. The third
               I have already described, and its results.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: cynical]</span><br>For a long time after, my mind was never without a lurking fear that the influence
               which had once taken possession of me might return again. Why should I have feared
               to be influenced, to be the messenger of a blessed creature, whose wishes could be
               nothing but heavenly? Who can say? Flesh and blood is not made for such encounters:
               they were more than I could bear. But nothing of the kind has ever occurred again.
               </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: optimism]</span><br><span class="character">Agnes</span> had her peaceful domestic throne established under the picture. My father wished
               it to be so, and spent his evenings there in the warmth and light, instead of in the
               old library,—in the narrow circle cleared by our lamp out of the darkness, as long
               as he lived. It is supposed by strangers that the picture on the wall is that of my
               wife; and I have always been glad that it should be so supposed. She who was my mother,
               who came back to me and became as my soul for three strange moments and no more, but
               with whom I can feel no credible relationship as she stands there, has retired for
               me into the tender regions of the unseen. She has passed once more into the secret
               company of those shadows, who can only become real in an atmosphere fitted to modify
               and harmonize all differences, and make all wonders possible,—the light of the perfect
               day.
