            <h1>The Judge’s House</h1>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> When the time for his examination drew near <span class="character">Malcolm Malcolmson</span> made up his mind to go
               somewhere to read by himself. He feared the attractions of the seaside, and also he
               feared
               completely rural isolation, for of old he knew it charms, and so he determined to
               find some
               unpretentious little town where there would be nothing to distract him. He refrained
               from
               asking suggestions from any of his friends, for he argued that each would recommend
               some
               place of which he had knowledge, and where he had already acquaintances. As <span class="character">Malcolmson</span>
               wished to avoid friends he had no wish to encumber himself with the attention of friends’
               friends, and so he determined to look out for a place for himself. He packed a portmanteau
               with some clothes and all the books he required, and then took ticket for the first
               name on
               the local time-table which he did not know.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> When at the end of three hours’ journey he alighted at <span class="place">Benchurch</span>, he felt satisfied that he
               had so far obliterated his tracks as to be sure of having a peaceful opportunity of
               pursuing
               his studies. He went straight to the one inn which the sleepy little place contained,
               and
               put up for the night. Benchurch was a market town, and once in three weeks was crowded
               to
               excess, but for the remainder of the twenty-one days it was as attractive as a desert.
               <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> looked around the day after his arrival to try to find quarters more isolated
               than even so quiet an inn as “The Good Traveller” afforded. There was only one place
               which
               took his fancy, and it certainly satisfied his wildest ideas regarding quiet; in fact,
               quiet
               was not the proper word to apply to it—desolation was the only term conveying any
               suitable
               idea of its isolation. It was an old rambling, heavy-built house of the Jacobean style,
               with
               heavy gables and windows, unusually small, and set higher than was customary in such
               houses,
               and was surrounded with a high brick wall massively built. Indeed, on examination,
               it looked
               more like a fortified house than an ordinary dwelling. But all these things pleased
               <span class="character">Malcolmson</span>. “Here,” he thought, “is the very spot I have been looking for, and if I can get
               opportunity of using it I shall be happy.” His joy was increased when he realised
               beyond
               doubt that it was not at present inhabited.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: optimism]</span><br> From the post-office he got the name of the agent, who was rarely surprised at the
               application to rent a part of the old house. Mr. Carnford, the local lawyer and agent,
               was a
               genial old gentleman, and frankly confessed his delight at anyone being willing to
               live in
               the house.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> “To tell you the truth,” said he, “I should be only too happy, on behalf of the owners,
               to
               let anyone have the house rent free for a term of years if only to accustom the people
               here
               to see it inhabited. It has been so long empty that some kind of absurd prejudice
               has grown
               up about it, and this can be best put down by its occupation—if only,” he added with
               a sly
               glance at <span class="character">Malcolmson</span>, “by a scholar like yourself, who wants its quiet for a time.”</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> thought it needless to ask the agent about the <span class="quote">“absurd prejudice”</span>; he knew he
               would get more information, if he should require it, on that subject from other quarters.
               He
               paid his three months’ rent, got a receipt, and the name of an old woman who would
               probably
               undertake to <span class="quote">“do”</span> for him, and came away with the keys in his pocket. He then went to the
               <span class="character">landlady</span> of the inn, who was a cheerful and most kindly person, and asked her advice as to
               such stores and provisions as he would be likely to require. She threw up her hands
               in
               amazement when he told her where he was going to settle himself.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> <span class="quote">“Not in the Judge’s House!”</span> she said, and grew pale as she spoke. He explained the locality
               of the house, saying that he did not know its name. When he had finished she answered:</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“Aye, sure enough—sure enough the very place! It is the Judge’s House sure enough.”</span> He asked
               her to tell him about the place, why so called, and what there was against it. She
               told him
               that it was so called locally because it had been many years before—how long she could
               not
               say, as she was herself from another part of the country, but she thought it must
               have been
               a hundred years or more—the abode of a judge who was held in great terror on account
               of his
               harsh sentences and his hostility to prisoners at Assizes. As to what there was against
               the
               house itself she could not tell. She had often asked, but no one could inform her;
               but there
               was a general feeling that there was something, and for her own part she would not
               take all
               the money in Drinkwater’s Bank and stay in the house an hour by herself. Then she
               apologised
               to <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> for her disturbing talk.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: fear]</span><br> <span class="quote">“It is too bad of me, sir, and you—and a young gentlemen, too—if you will pardon me
                  saying
                  it, going to live there all alone. If you were my boy—and you’ll excuse me for saying
                  it—you
                  wouldn’t sleep there a night, not if I had to go there myself and pull the big alarm
                  bell
                  that’s on the roof!”</span> The good creature was so manifestly in earnest, and was so kindly in
               her intentions, that <span class="character">Malcolmson</span>, although amused, was touched. He told her kindly how much
               he appreciated her interest in him, and added:</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: fear]</span><br> <span class="quote">“But, my dear <span class="character">Mrs. Witham</span>, indeed you need not be concerned about me! A man who is reading
                  for the Mathematical Tripos has too much to think of to be disturbed by any of these
                  mysterious <span class="quote">‘somethings’</span>, and his work is of too exact and prosaic a kind to allow of his
                  having any corner in his mind for mysteries of any kind. Harmonical Progression,
                  Permutations and Combinations, and Elliptic Functions have sufficient mysteries for
                  me!”</span>
               <span class="character">Mrs. Witham</span> kindly undertook to see after his commissions, and he went himself to look for
               the old woman who had been recommended to him. When he returned to the Judge’s House
               with
               her, after an interval of a couple of hours, he found <span class="character">Mrs. Witham</span> herself waiting with
               several men and boys carrying parcels, and an upholsterer’s man with a bed in a car,
               for she
               said, though tables and chairs might be all very well, a bed that hadn’t been aired
               for
               mayhap fifty years was not proper for young bones to lie on. She was evidently curious
               to
               see the inside of the house; and though manifestly so afraid of the <span class="quote">“somethings”</span> that at the
               slightest sound she clutched on to <span class="character">Malcolmson</span>, whom she never left for a moment, went over
               the whole place.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: happiness]</span><br> After his examination of the house, <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> decided to take up his abode in the great
               dining-room, which was big enough to serve for all his requirements; and <span class="character">Mrs. Witham,</span> with
               the aid of the charwoman, <span class="character">Mrs. Dempster</span>, proceeded to arrange matters. When the hampers were
               brought in and unpacked, <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> saw that with much kind forethought she had sent from
               her own kitchen sufficient provisions to last for a few days. Before going she expressed
               all
               sorts of kind wishes; and at the door turned and said:</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: fear]</span><br> <span class="quote">“And perhaps, sir, as the room is big and draughty it might be well to have one of
                  those big
                  screens put round your bed at night—though, truth to tell, I would die myself if I
                  were to
                  be so shut in with all kinds of—of ‘things’, that put their heads round the sides,
                  or over
                  the top, and look on me!”</span> The image which she had called up was too much for her nerves, and
               she fled incontinently.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: cynical]</span><br> <span class="character">Mrs. Dempster</span> sniffed in a superior manner as the <span class="character"> landlady</span> disappeared, and remarked that
               for her own part she wasn’t afraid of all the bogies in the kingdom.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: fear]</span><br> <span class="quote">“I’ll tell you what it is, sir,” </span>she said; <span class="quote">“bogies is all kinds and sorts of things—except
                  bogies! Rats and mice, and beetles; and creaky doors, and loose slates, and broken
                  panes,
                  and stiff drawer handles, that stay out when you pull them and then fall down in the
                  middle
                  of the night. Look at the wainscot of the room! It is old—hundreds of years old! Do
                  you
                  think there’s no rats and beetles there! And do you imagine, sir, that you won’t see
                  none of
                  them? Rats is bogies, I tell you, and bogies is rats; and don’t you get to think anything
                  else!”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: cynical]</span><br> <span class="quote"><span class="character">“Mrs. Dempster,”</span></span> said <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> gravely, making her a polite bow, <span class="quote">“you know more than a
                  Senior Wrangler! And let me say, that, as a mark of esteem for your indubitable soundness
                  of
                  head and heart, I shall, when I go, give you possession of this house, and let you
                  stay here
                  by yourself for the last two months of my tenancy, for four weeks will serve my
                  purpose.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: cynical]</span><br> <span class="quote">“Thank you kindly, sir!” </span>she answered, <span class="quote">“but I couldn’t sleep away from home a night. I am in
                  Greenhow’s Charity, and if I slept a night away from my rooms I should lose all I
                  have got
                  to live on. The rules is very strict; and there’s too many watching for a vacancy
                  for me to
                  run any risks in the matter. Only for that, sir, I’d gladly come here and attend on
                  you
                  altogether during your stay.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: ironic]</span><br> <span class="quote">“My good woman,”</span> said <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> hastily, “<span class="quote">I have come here on purpose to obtain solitude;
                  and believe me that I am grateful to the late Greenhow for having so organised his
                  admirable
                  charity—whatever it is—that I am perforce denied the opportunity of suffering from
                  such a
                  form of temptation! Saint Anthony himself could not be more rigid on the point!”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> The old woman laughed harshly. <span class="quote">“Ah, you young gentlemen,”</span> she said, “you don’t fear for
               naught; and belike you’ll get all the solitude you want here.” She set to work with
               her
               cleaning; and by nightfall, when <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> returned from his walk—he always had one of his
               books to study as he walked—he found the room swept and tidied, a fire burning in
               the old
               hearth, the lamp lit, and the table spread for supper with <span class="character">Mrs. Witham’s</span> excellent fare.
               <span class="quote"> “This is comfort, indeed,”</span> he said, as he rubbed his hands.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> When he had finished his supper, and lifted the tray to the other end of the great
               oak
               dining-table, he got out his books again, put fresh wood on the fire, trimmed his
               lamp, and
               set himself down to a spell of real hard work. He went on without pause till about
               eleven
               o’clock, when he knocked off for a bit to fix his fire and lamp, and to make himself
               a cup
               of tea. He had always been a tea-drinker, and during his college life had sat late
               at work
               and had taken tea late. The rest was a great luxury to him, and he enjoyed it with
               a sense
               of delicious, voluptuous ease. The renewed fire leaped and sparkled, and threw quaint
               shadows through the great old room; and as he sipped his hot tea he revelled in the
               sense of
               isolation from his kind. Then it was that he began to notice for the first time what
               a noise
               the rats were making.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“Surely,”</span> he thought, “they cannot have been at it all the time I was reading. Had they
               been, I must have noticed it!” Presently, when the noise increased, he satisfied himself
               that it was really new. It was evident that at first the rats had been frightened
               at the
               presence of a stranger, and the light of fire and lamp; but that as the time went
               on they
               had grown bolder and were now disporting themselves as was their wont.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> How busy they were! and hark to the strange noises! Up and down behind the old wainscot,
               over the ceiling and under the floor they raced, and gnawed, and scratched! <span class="character">Malcolmson</span>
               smiled to himself as he recalled to mind the saying of <span class="character">Mrs. Dempster,</span> <span class="quote">“Bogies is rats, and
                  rats is bogies!”</span> The tea began to have its effect of intellectual and nervous stimulus, he
               saw with joy another long spell of work to be done before the night was past, and
               in the
               sense of security which it gave him, he allowed himself the luxury of a good look
               round the
               room. He took his lamp in one hand, and went all around, wondering that so quaint
               and
               beautiful an old house had been so long neglected. The carving of the oak on the panels
               of
               the wainscot was fine, and on and round the doors and windows it was beautiful and
               of rare
               merit. There were some old pictures on the walls, but they were coated so thick with
               dust
               and dirt that he could not distinguish any detail of them, though he held his lamp
               as high
               as he could over his head. Here and there as he went round he saw some crack or hole
               blocked
               for a moment by the face of a rat with its bright eyes glittering in the light, but
               in an
               instant it was gone, and a squeak and a scamper followed. The thing that most struck
               him,
               however, was the rope of the great alarm bell on the roof, which hung down in a corner
               of
               the room on the right-hand side of the fireplace. He pulled up close to the hearth
               a great
               high-backed carved oak chair, and sat down to his last cup of tea. When this was done
               he
               made up the fire, and went back to his work, sitting at the corner of the table, having
               the
               fire to his left. For a little while the rats disturbed him somewhat with their perpetual
               scampering, but he got accustomed to the noise as one does to the ticking of a clock
               or to
               the roar of moving water; and he became so immersed in his work that everything in
               the
               world, except the problem which he was trying to solve, passed away from him.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> He suddenly looked up, his problem was still unsolved, and there was in the air that
               sense
               of the hour before the dawn, which is so dread to doubtful life. The noise of the
               rats had
               ceased. Indeed it seemed to him that it must have ceased but lately and that it was
               the
               sudden cessation which had disturbed him. The fire had fallen low, but still it threw
               out a
               deep red glow. As he looked he started in spite of his sang froid.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> There on the great high-backed carved oak chair by the right side of the fireplace
               sat an
               enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with baleful eyes. He made a motion to it as
               though to
               hunt it away, but it did not stir. Then he made the motion of throwing something.
               Still it
               did not stir, but showed its great white teeth angrily, and its cruel eyes shone in
               the
               lamplight with an added vindictiveness.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> felt amazed, and seizing the poker from the hearth ran at it to kill it. Before,
               however, he could strike it, the rat, with a squeak that sounded like the concentration
               of
               hate, jumped upon the floor, and, running up the rope of the alarm bell, disappeared
               in the
               darkness beyond the range of the green-shaded lamp. Instantly, strange to say, the
               noisy
               scampering of the rats in the wainscot began again.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> By this time <span class="character">Malcolmson’s </span>mind was quite off the problem; and as a shrill cock-crow outside
               told him of the approach of morning, he went to bed and to sleep.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> He slept so sound that he was not even waked by <span class="character">Mrs. Dempster</span> coming in to make up his room.
               It was only when she had tidied up the place and got his breakfast ready and tapped
               on the
               screen which closed in his bed that he woke. He was a little tired still after his
               night’s
               hard work, but a strong cup of tea soon freshened him up and, taking his book, he
               went out
               for his morning walk, bringing with him a few sandwiches lest he should not care to
               return
               till dinner time. He found a quiet walk between high elms some way outside the town,
               and
               here he spent the greater part of the day studying his Laplace. On his return he looked
               in
               to see <span class="character">Mrs. Witham</span> and to thank her for her kindness. When she saw him coming through the
               diamond-paned bay window of her sanctum she came out to meet him and asked him in.
               She
               looked at him searchingly and shook her head as she said:</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“You must not overdo it, sir. You are paler this morning than you should be. Too late
                  hours
                  and too hard work on the brain isn’t good for any man! But tell me, sir, how did you
                  pass
                  the night? Well, I hope? But my heart! sir, I was glad when <span class="character">Mrs. Dempster </span>told me this
                  morning that you were all right and sleeping sound when she went in.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“Oh, I was all right,” </span>he answered smiling, <span class="quote">“the ‘somethings’ didn’t worry me, as yet. Only
                  the rats; and they had a circus, I tell you, all over the place. There was one wicked
                  looking old devil that sat up on my own chair by the fire, and wouldn’t go till I
                  took the
                  poker to him, and then he ran up the rope of the alarm bell and got to somewhere up
                  the wall
                  or the ceiling—I couldn’t see where, it was so dark.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“Mercy on us,”</span> said <span class="character">Mrs. Witham</span>, <span class="quote">“an old devil, and sitting on a chair by the fireside! Take
                  care, sir! take care! There’s many a true word spoken in jest.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“How do you mean? Pon my word I don’t understand.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“An old devil! The old devil, perhaps. There! sir, you needn’t laugh,” </span>for <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> had
               broken into a hearty peal. <span class="quote">“You young folks thinks it easy to laugh at things that makes
                  older ones shudder. Never mind, sir! never mind! Please God, you’ll laugh all the
                  time. It’s
                  what I wish you myself!”</span> and the good lady beamed all over in sympathy with his enjoyment,
               her fears gone for a moment.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“Oh, forgive me!”</span> said <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> presently. “Don’t think me rude; but the idea was too much
               for me—that the old devil himself was on the chair last night!” And at the thought
               he
               laughed again. Then he went home to dinner.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> This evening the scampering of the rats began earlier; indeed it had been going on
               before
               his arrival, and only ceased whilst his presence by its freshness disturbed them.
               After
               dinner he sat by the fire for a while and had a smoke; and then, having cleared his
               table,
               began to work as before. Tonight the rats disturbed him more than they had done on
               the
               previous night. How they scampered up and down and under and over! How they squeaked,
               and
               scratched, and gnawed! How they, getting bolder by degrees, came to the mouths of
               their
               holes and to the chinks and cracks and crannies in the wainscoting till their eyes
               shone
               like tiny lamps as the firelight rose and fell. But to him, now doubtless accustomed
               to
               them, their eyes were not wicked; only their playfulness touched him. Sometimes the
               boldest
               of them made sallies out on the floor or along the mouldings of the wainscot. Now
               and again
               as they disturbed him <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> made a sound to frighten them, smiting the table with his
               hand or giving a fierce <span class="quote">“Hsh, hsh,”</span> so that they fled straightway to their holes.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> And so the early part of the night wore on; and despite the noise <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> got more and
               more immersed in his work.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> All at once he stopped, as on the previous night, being overcome by a sudden sense
               of
               silence. There was not the faintest sound of gnaw, or scratch, or squeak. The silence
               was as
               of the grave. He remembered the odd occurrence of the previous night, and instinctively
               he
               looked at the chair standing close by the fireside. And then a very odd sensation
               thrilled
               through him.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> There, on the great old high-backed carved oak chair beside the fireplace sat the
               same
               enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with baleful eyes.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> Instinctively he took the nearest thing to his hand, a book of logarithms, and flung
               it at
               it. The book was badly aimed and the rat did not stir, so again the poker performance
               of the
               previous night was repeated; and again the rat, being closely pursued, fled up the
               rope of
               the alarm bell. Strangely too, the departure of this rat was instantly followed by
               the
               renewal of the noise made by the general rat community. On this occasion, as on the
               previous
               one, <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> could not see at what part of the room the rat disappeared, for the green
               shade of his lamp left the upper part of the room in darkness, and the fire had burned
               low.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> On looking at his watch he found it was close on midnight; and, not sorry for the
               divertissement, he made up his fire and made himself his nightly pot of tea. He had
               got
               through a good spell of work, and thought himself entitled to a cigarette; and so
               he sat on
               the great oak chair before the fire and enjoyed it. Whilst smoking he began to think
               that he
               would like to know where the rat disappeared to, for he had certain ideas for the
               morrow not
               entirely disconnected with a rat-trap. Accordingly he lit another lamp and placed
               it so that
               it would shine well into the right-hand corner of the wall by the fireplace. Then
               he got all
               the books he had with him, and placed them handy to throw at the vermin. Finally he
               lifted
               the rope of the alarm bell and placed the end of it on the table, fixing the extreme
               end
               under the lamp. As he handled it he could not help noticing how pliable it was, especially
               for so strong a rope, and one not in use.<span class="quote"> “You could hang a man with it,</span>” he thought to
               himself. When his preparations were made he looked around, and said complacently:</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“There now, my friend, I think we shall learn something of you this time!” </span>He began his work
               again, and though as before somewhat disturbed at first by the noise of the rats,
               soon lost
               himself in his propositions and problems.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> Again he was called to his immediate surroundings suddenly. This time it might not
               have been
               the sudden silence only which took his attention; there was a slight movement of the
               rope,
               and the lamp moved. Without stirring, he looked to see if his pile of books was within
               range, and then cast his eye along the rope. As he looked he saw the great rat drop
               from the
               rope on the oak arm-chair and sit there glaring at him. He raised a book in his right
               hand,
               and taking careful aim, flung it at the rat. The latter, with a quick movement, sprang
               aside
               and dodged the missile. He then took another book, and a third, and flung them one
               after
               another at the rat, but each time unsuccessfully. At last, as he stood with a book
               poised in
               his hand to throw, the rat squeaked and seemed afraid. This made <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> more than ever
               eager to strike, and the book flew and struck the rat a resounding blow. It gave a
               terrified
               squeak, and turning on his pursuer a look of terrible malevolence, ran up the chair-back
               and
               made a great jump to the rope of the alarm bell and ran up it like lightning. The
               lamp
               rocked under the sudden strain, but it was a heavy one and did not topple over. <span class="character">Malcolmson</span>
               kept his eyes on the rat, and saw it by the light of the second lamp leap to a moulding
               of
               the wainscot and disappear through a hole in one of the great pictures which hung
               on the
               wall, obscured and invisible through its coating of dirt and dust.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“I shall look up my friend’s habitation in the morning,”</span> said the student, as he went over
               to collect his books. <span class="quote">“The third picture from the fireplace; I shall not forget.” He picked
                  up the books one by one, commenting on them as he lifted them. “Conic Sections he
                  does not
                  mind, nor Cycloidal Oscillations, nor the Principia, nor Quaternions, nor Thermodynamics.
                  Now for the book that fetched him!” </span><span class="character">Malcolmson</span> took it up and looked at it. As he did so he
               started, and a sudden pallor overspread his face. He looked round uneasily and shivered
               slightly, as he murmured to himself:</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“The Bible my mother gave me! What an odd coincidence.”</span> He sat down to work again, and the
               rats in the wainscot renewed their gambols. They did not disturb him, however; somehow
               their
               presence gave him a sense of companionship. But he could not attend to his work, and
               after
               striving to master the subject on which he was engaged gave it up in despair, and
               went to
               bed as the first streak of dawn stole in through the eastern window.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> He slept heavily but uneasily, and dreamed much; and when <span class="character">Mrs. Dempster </span>woke him late in the
               morning he seemed ill at ease, and for a few minutes did not seem to realise exactly
               where
               he was. His first request rather surprised the servant.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“<span class="character">Mrs. Dempster</span>, when I am out to-day I wish you would get the steps and dust or wash those
                  pictures—specially that one the third from the fireplace—I want to see what they are.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> Late in the afternoon <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> worked at his books in the shaded walk, and the
               cheerfulness of the previous day came back to him as the day wore on, and he found
               that his
               reading was progressing well. He had worked out to a satisfactory conclusion all the
               problems which had as yet baffled him, and it was in a state of jubilation that he
               paid a
               visit to <span class="character">Mrs. Witham </span>at <span class="quote">“The Good Traveller”.</span> He found a stranger in the cosy sitting-room
               with the <span class="character">landlady</span>, who was introduced to him as <span class="character">Dr. Thornhill</span>. She was not quite at ease,
               and this, combined with the <span class="character"> doctor </span>’s plunging at once into a series of questions, made
               <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> come to the conclusion that his presence was not an accident, so without
               preliminary he said:</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“<span class="character">Dr. Thornhill,</span> I shall with pleasure answer you any question you may choose to ask me if
                  you will answer me one question first.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> The <span class="character"> doctor </span> seemed surprised, but he smiled and answered at once,<span class="quote"> “Done! What is it?”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> “<span class="quote">Did <span class="character">Mrs. Witham</span> ask you to come here and see me and advise me?”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="character">Dr. Thornhill</span> for a moment was taken aback, and <span class="character">Mrs. Witham</span> got fiery red and turned away;
               but the <span class="character"> doctor </span> was a frank and ready man, and he answered at once and openly.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“She did: but she didn’t intend you to know it. I suppose it was my clumsy haste that
                  made
                  you suspect. She told me that she did not like the idea of your being in that house
                  all by
                  yourself, and that she thought you took too much strong tea. In fact, she wants me
                  to advise
                  you if possible to give up the tea and the very late hours. I was a keen student in
                  my time,
                  so I suppose I may take the liberty of a college man, and without offence, advise
                  you not
                  quite as a stranger.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> with a bright smile held out his hand. <span class="quote">“Shake! as they say in America,” he said.
                  “I must thank you for your kindness and <span class="character">Mrs. Witham</span> too, and your kindness deserves a return
                  on my part. I promise to take no more strong tea—no tea at all till you let me—and
                  I shall
                  go to bed tonight at one o’clock at latest. Will that do?”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“Capital,”</span> said the <span class="character"> doctor </span>. <span class="quote">“Now tell us all that you noticed in the old house,”</span> and so
               <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> then and there told in minute detail all that had happened in the last two
               nights. He was interrupted every now and then by some exclamation from <span class="character">Mrs. Witham</span>, till
               finally when he told of the episode of the Bible the <span class="character">landlady</span>’s pent-up emotions found vent
               in a shriek; and it was not till a stiff glass of brandy and water had been administered
               that she grew composed again. <span class="character">Dr. Thornhill</span> listened with a face of growing gravity, and
               when the narrative was complete and <span class="character">Mrs. Witham</span> had been restored he asked:</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: cynical]</span><br> <span class="quote">“The rat always went up the rope of the alarm bell?”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: anger]</span><br> “Always.”</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: anger]</span><br> <span class="quote">“I suppose you know,”</span> said the <span class="character"> Doctor </span> after a pause, “what the rope is?”</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: anger]</span><br> <span class="quote">“No!”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: anger]</span><br>  <span class="quote">“It is,”</span> said the <span class="character"> Doctor </span> slowly, <span class="quote">“the very rope which the hangman used for all the victims
                  of the Judge’s judicial rancour!”</span> Here he was interrupted by another scream from Mrs.
               Witham, and steps had to be taken for her recovery. <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> having looked at his watch,
               and found that it was close to his dinner hour, had gone home before her complete
               recovery.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: anger]</span><br> When <span class="character">Mrs. Witham</span> was herself again she almost assailed the <span class="character"> Doctor </span> with angry questions as to
               what he meant by putting such horrible ideas into the poor young man’s mind. <span class="quote">“He has quite
                  enough there already to upset him,”</span> she added. <span class="character">Dr. Thornhill </span>replied:</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> <span class="quote">“My dear madam, I had a distinct purpose in it! I wanted to draw his attention to
                  the bell
                  rope, and to fix it there. It may be that he is in a highly overwrought state, and
                  has been
                  studying too much, although I am bound to say that he seems as sound and healthy a
                  young
                  man, mentally and bodily, as ever I saw—but then the rats—and that suggestion of the
                  devil.”</span>
               The <span class="character"> doctor </span> shook his head and went on. <span class="quote">“I would have offered to go and stay the first night
                  with him but that I felt sure it would have been a cause of offence. He may get in
                  the night
                  some strange fright or hallucination; and if he does I want him to pull that rope.
                  All alone
                  as he is it will give us warning, and we may reach him in time to be of service. I
                  shall be
                  sitting up pretty late tonight and shall keep my ears open. Do not be alarmed if Benchurch
                  gets a surprise before morning.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> <span class="quote">“Oh, <span class="character"> Doctor </span>, what do you mean? What do you mean?”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> <span class="quote">“I mean this; that possibly—nay, more probably—we shall hear the great alarm bell
                  from the
                  Judge’s House tonight,” </span>and the <span class="character"> Doctor </span> made about as effective an exit as could be thought
               of.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: serious]</span><br> When <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> arrived home he found that it was a little after his usual time, and Mrs.
               Dempster had gone away—the rules of Greenhow’s Charity were not to be neglected. He
               was glad
               to see that the place was bright and tidy with a cheerful fire and a well-trimmed
               lamp. The
               evening was colder than might have been expected in April, and a heavy wind was blowing
               with
               such rapidly-increasing strength that there was every promise of a storm during the
               night.
               For a few minutes after his entrance the noise of the rats ceased; but so soon as
               they
               became accustomed to his presence they began again. He was glad to hear them, for
               he felt
               once more the feeling of companionship in their noise, and his mind ran back to the
               strange
               fact that they only ceased to manifest themselves when that other—the great rat with
               the
               baleful eyes—came upon the scene. The reading-lamp only was lit and its green shade
               kept the
               ceiling and the upper part of the room in darkness, so that the cheerful light from
               the
               hearth spreading over the floor and shining on the white cloth laid over the end of
               the
               table was warm and cheery. <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> sat down to his dinner with a good appetite and a
               buoyant spirit. After his dinner and a cigarette he sat steadily down to work, determined
               not to let anything disturb him, for he remembered his promise to the <span class="character"> doctor </span>, and made up
               his mind to make the best of the time at his disposal.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> For an hour or so he worked all right, and then his thoughts began to wander from
               his books.
               The actual circumstances around him, the calls on his physical attention, and his
               nervous
               susceptibility were not to be denied. By this time the wind had become a gale, and
               the gale
               a storm. The old house, solid though it was, seemed to shake to its foundations, and
               the
               storm roared and raged through its many chimneys and its queer old gables, producing
               strange, unearthly sounds in the empty rooms and corridors. Even the great alarm bell
               on the
               roof must have felt the force of the wind, for the rope rose and fell slightly, as
               though
               the bell were moved a little from time to time and the limber rope fell on the oak
               floor
               with a hard and hollow sound.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> As <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> listened to it he bethought himself of the <span class="character"> doctor </span>’s words, “It is the rope
               which the hangman used for the victims of the Judge’s judicial rancour,” and he went
               over to
               the corner of the fireplace and took it in his hand to look at it. There seemed a
               sort of
               deadly interest in it, and as he stood there he lost himself for a moment in speculation
               as
               to who these victims were, and the grim wish of the Judge to have such a ghastly relic
               ever
               under his eyes. As he stood there the swaying of the bell on the roof still lifted
               the rope
               now and again; but presently there came a new sensation—a sort of tremor in the rope,
               as
               though something was moving along it.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> Looking up instinctively <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> saw the great rat coming slowly down towards him,
               glaring at him steadily. He dropped the rope and started back with a muttered curse,
               and the
               rat turning ran up the rope again and disappeared, and at the same instant <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> became
               conscious that the noise of the rats, which had ceased for a while, began again.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> All this set him thinking, and it occurred to him that he had not investigated the
               lair of
               the rat or looked at the pictures, as he had intended. He lit the other lamp without
               the
               shade, and, holding it up went and stood opposite the third picture from the fireplace
               on
               the right-hand side where he had seen the rat disappear on the previous night.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> At the first glance he started back so suddenly that he almost dropped the lamp,
               and a
               deadly pallor overspread his face. His knees shook, and heavy drops of sweat came
               on his
               forehead, and he trembled like an aspen. But he was young and plucky, and pulled himself
               together, and after the pause of a few seconds stepped forward again, raised the lamp,
               and
               examined the picture which had been dusted and washed, and now stood out clearly.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> It was of a judge dressed in his robes of scarlet and ermine. His face was strong
               and
               merciless, evil, crafty, and vindictive, with a sensual mouth, hooked nose of ruddy
               colour,
               and shaped like the beak of a bird of prey. The rest of the face was of a cadaverous
               colour.
               The eyes were of peculiar brilliance and with a terribly malignant expression. As
               he looked
               at them, <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> grew cold, for he saw there the very counterpart of the eyes of the
               great rat. The lamp almost fell from his hand, he saw the rat with its baleful eyes
               peering
               out through the hole in the corner of the picture, and noted the sudden cessation
               of the
               noise of the other rats. However, he pulled himself together, and went on with his
               examination of the picture.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: fear]</span><br> The Judge was seated in a great high-backed carved oak chair, on the right-hand side
               of a
               great stone fireplace where, in the corner, a rope hung down from the ceiling, its
               end lying
               coiled on the floor. With a feeling of something like horror, <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> recognised the
               scene of the room as it stood, and gazed around him in an awestruck manner as though
               he
               expected to find some strange presence behind him. Then he looked over to the corner
               of the
               fireplace—and with a loud cry he let the lamp fall from his hand.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> There, in the Judge’s arm-chair, with the rope hanging behind, sat the rat with the
               Judge’s
               baleful eyes, now intensified and with a fiendish leer. Save for the howling of the
               storm
               without there was silence.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: cynical]</span><br> The fallen lamp recalled <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> to himself. Fortunately it was of metal, and so the oil
               was not spilt. However, the practical need of attending to it settled at once his
               nervous
               apprehensions. When he had turned it out, he wiped his brow and thought for a moment.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: cynical]</span><br> <span class="quote">“This will not do,” </span>he said to himself. <span class="quote">“If I go on like this I shall become a crazy fool.
                  This must stop! I promised the <span class="character"> doctor </span> I would not take tea. Faith, he was pretty right! My
                  nerves must have been getting into a queer state. Funny I did not notice it. I never
                  felt
                  better in my life. However, it is all right now, and I shall not be such a fool again.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: cynical]</span><br> Then he mixed himself a good stiff glass of brandy and water and resolutely sat down
               to his
               work.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> It was nearly an hour when he looked up from his book, disturbed by the sudden stillness.
               Without, the wind howled and roared louder than ever, and the rain drove in sheets
               against
               the windows, beating like hail on the glass; but within there was no sound whatever
               save the
               echo of the wind as it roared in the great chimney, and now and then a hiss as a few
               raindrops found their way down the chimney in a lull of the storm. The fire had fallen
               low
               and had ceased to flame, though it threw out a red glow. <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> listened attentively,
               and presently heard a thin, squeaking noise, very faint. It came from the corner of
               the room
               where the rope hung down, and he thought it was the creaking of the rope on the floor
               as the
               swaying of the bell raised and lowered it. Looking up, however, he saw in the dim
               light the
               great rat clinging to the rope and gnawing it. The rope was already nearly gnawed
               through—he
               could see the lighter colour where the strands were laid bare. As he looked the job
               was
               completed, and the severed end of the rope fell clattering on the oaken floor, whilst
               for an
               instant the great rat remained like a knob or tassel at the end of the rope, which
               now began
               to sway to and fro. <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> felt for a moment another pang of terror as he thought that
               now the possibility of calling the outer world to his assistance was cut off, but
               an intense
               anger took its place, and seizing the book he was reading he hurled it at the rat.
               The blow
               was well aimed, but before the missile could reach him the rat dropped off and struck
               the
               floor with a soft thud. <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> instantly rushed over towards him, but it darted away and
               disappeared in the darkness of the shadows of the room. <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> felt that his work was
               over for the night, and determined then and there to vary the monotony of the proceedings
               by
               a hunt for the rat, and took off the green shade of the lamp so as to insure a wider
               spreading light. As he did so the gloom of the upper part of the room was relieved,
               and in
               the new flood of light, great by comparison with the previous darkness, the pictures
               on the
               wall stood out boldly. From where he stood, <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> saw right opposite to him the third
               picture on the wall from the right of the fireplace. He rubbed his eyes in surprise,
               and
               then a great fear began to come upon him.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> In the centre of the picture was a great irregular patch of brown canvas, as fresh
               as when
               it was stretched on the frame. The background was as before, with chair and chimney-corner
               and rope, but the figure of the Judge had disappeared.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> <span class="character">Malcolmson</span>, almost in a chill of horror, turned slowly round, and then he began to shake and
               tremble like a man in a palsy. His strength seemed to have left him, and he was incapable
               of
               action or movement, hardly even of thought. He could only see and hear.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> There, on the great high-backed carved oak chair sat the Judge in his robes of scarlet
               and
               ermine, with his baleful eyes glaring vindictively, and a smile of triumph on the
               resolute,
               cruel mouth, as he lifted with his hands a black cap. <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> felt as if the blood was
               running from his heart, as one does in moments of prolonged suspense. There was a
               singing in
               his ears. Without, he could hear the roar and howl of the tempest, and through it,
               swept on
               the storm, came the striking of midnight by the great chimes in the market place.
               He stood
               for a space of time that seemed to him endless still as a statue, and with wide-open,
               horror-struck eyes, breathless. As the clock struck, so the smile of triumph on the
               Judge’s
               face intensified, and at the last stroke of midnight he placed the black cap on his
               head.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> Slowly and deliberately the Judge rose from his chair and picked up the piece of
               the rope of
               the alarm bell which lay on the floor, drew it through his hands as if he enjoyed
               its touch,
               and then deliberately began to knot one end of it, fashioning it into a noose. This
               he
               tightened and tested with his foot, pulling hard at it till he was satisfied and then
               making
               a running noose of it, which he held in his hand. Then he began to move along the
               table on
               the opposite side to <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> keeping his eyes on him until he had passed him, when with a
               quick movement he stood in front of the door. <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> then began to feel that he was
               trapped, and tried to think of what he should do. There was some fascination in the
               Judge’s
               eyes, which he never took off him, and he had, perforce, to look. He saw the Judge
               approach—still keeping between him and the door—and raise the noose and throw it towards
               him
               as if to entangle him. With a great effort he made a quick movement to one side, and
               saw the
               rope fall beside him, and heard it strike the oaken floor. Again the Judge raised
               the noose
               and tried to ensnare him, ever keeping his baleful eyes fixed on him, and each time
               by a
               mighty effort the student just managed to evade it. So this went on for many times,
               the
               Judge seeming never discouraged nor discomposed at failure, but playing as a cat does
               with a
               mouse. At last in despair, which had reached its climax, <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> cast a quick glance
               round him. The lamp seemed to have blazed up, and there was a fairly good light in
               the room.
               At the many rat-holes and in the chinks and crannies of the wainscot he saw the rats’
               eyes;
               and this aspect, that was purely physical, gave him a gleam of comfort. He looked
               around and
               saw that the rope of the great alarm bell was laden with rats. Every inch of it was
               covered
               with them, and more and more were pouring through the small circular hole in the ceiling
               whence it emerged, so that with their weight the bell was beginning to sway.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> Hark! it had swayed till the clapper had touched the bell. The sound was but a tiny
               one, but
               the bell was only beginning to sway, and it would increase.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> At the sound the Judge, who had been keeping his eyes fixed on <span class="character">Malcolmson</span>, looked up, and a
               scowl of diabolical anger overspread his face. His eyes fairly glowed like hot coals,
               and he
               stamped his foot with a sound that seemed to make the house shake. A dreadful peal
               of
               thunder broke overhead as he raised the rope again, whilst the rats kept running up
               and down
               the rope as though working against time. This time, instead of throwing it, he drew
               close to
               his victim, and held open the noose as he approached. As he came closer there seemed
               something paralysing in his very presence, and <span class="character">Malcolmson</span> stood rigid as a corpse. He felt
               the Judge’s icy fingers touch his throat as he adjusted the rope. The noose
               tightened—tightened. Then the Judge, taking the rigid form of the student in his arms,
               carried him over and placed him standing in the oak chair, and stepping up beside
               him, put
               his hand up and caught the end of the swaying rope of the alarm bell. As he raised
               his hand
               the rats fled squeaking, and disappeared through the hole in the ceiling. Taking the
               end of
               the noose which was round <span class="character">Malcolmson</span>’s neck he tied it to the hanging-bell rope, and then
               descending pulled away the chair.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> When the alarm bell of the Judge’s House began to sound a crowd soon assembled. Lights
               and
               torches of various kinds appeared, and soon a silent crowd was hurrying to the spot.
               They
               knocked loudly at the door, but there was no reply. Then they burst in the door, and
               poured
               into the great dining-room, the <span class="character"> doctor </span> at the head.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">[Tone: suspenseful]</span><br> There at the end of the rope of the great alarm bell hung the body of the student,
               and on
               the face of the Judge in the picture was a malignant smile. </p>
