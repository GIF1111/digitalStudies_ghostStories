            <span class="place">Brentwood</span> stands on that fine and wealthy slope of country—one of the richest in Scotland—which
            lies between the Pentland Hills and the Firth. In clear weather you could see the
            blue gleam—like a bent bow, embracing the wealthy fields and scattered houses—of the
            great estuary on one side of you, and on the other the blue heights, not gigantic
            like those we had been used to, but just high enough for all the glories of the atmosphere,
            the play of clouds, and sweet reflections, which give to a hilly country an interest
            and a charm which nothing else can emulate. <span class="place">Edinburgh</span>—with its two lesser heights, the Castle and the Calton Hill, its spires and towers
            piercing through the smoke, and Arthur’s Seat lying crouched behind, like a guardian
            no longer very needful, taking his repose beside the well-beloved charge, which is
            now, so to speak, able to take care of itself without him—lay at our right hand. From
            the lawn and drawing-room windows we could see all these varieties of landscape. The
            color was sometimes a little chilly, but sometimes, also, as animated and full of
            vicissitude as a drama. I was never tired of it. Its color and freshness revived the
            eyes which had grown weary of arid plains and blazing skies. It was always cheery,
            and fresh, and full of repose.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            The summer was a very happy period of repose for us all. The warmth of Indian suns
            was still in our veins. It seemed to us that we could never have enough of the greenness,
            the dewiness, the freshness of the northern landscape. Even its mists were pleasant
            to us, taking all the fever out of us, and pouring in vigor and refreshment. In autumn
            we followed the fashion of the time, and went away for change which we did not in
            the least require. It was when the family had settled down for the winter, when the
            days were short and dark, and the rigorous reign of frost upon us, that the incidents
            occurred which alone could justify me in intruding upon the world my private affairs.
            These incidents were, however, of so curious a character, that I hope my inevitable
            references to my own family and pressing personal interests will meet with a general
            pardon.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            But I was confident in my home-comfort and peacefulness. When I got back to my club,
            however, three or four letters were lying for one, upon some of which I noticed the
            <span class="quote">“immediate,”</span> <span class="quote">“urgent,”</span> which old-fashioned people and anxious people still believe will influence the post-office
            and quicken the speed of the mails. I was about to open one of these, when the club
            porter brought me two telegrams, one of which, he said, had arrived the night before.
            I opened, as was to be expected, the last first, and this was what I read: <span class="quote">“Why don’t you come or answer? For God’s sake, come. He is much worse.”</span> This was a thunderbolt to fall upon a man’s head who had one only son, and he the
            light of his eyes! The other telegram, which I opened with hands trembling so much
            that I lost time by my haste, was to much the same purport: <span class="quote">“No better; doctor afraid of brain-fever. Calls for you day and night. Let nothing
               detain you.”</span> The first thing I did was to look up the time-tables to see if there was any way
            of getting off sooner than by the night-train, though I knew well enough there was
            not; and then I read the letters, which furnished, alas! too clearly, all the details.
            They told me that the boy had been pale for some time, with a scared look. His mother
            had noticed it before I left home, but would not say anything to alarm me. This look
            had increased day by day: and soon it was observed that <span class="character">Roland</span> came home at a wild gallop through the park, his pony panting and in foam, himself
            <span class="quote">“as white as a sheet,”</span> but with the perspiration streaming from his forehead. For a long time he had resisted
            all questioning, but at length had developed such strange changes of mood, showing
            a reluctance to go to school, a desire to be fetched in the carriage at night,—which
            was a ridiculous piece of luxury,—an unwillingness to go out into the grounds, and
            nervous start at every sound, that his mother had insisted upon an explanation. When
            the boy—our boy <span class="character">Roland</span>, who had never known what fear was—began to talk to her of voices he had heard in
            the park, and shadows that had appeared to him among the ruins, my wife promptly put
            him to bed and sent for Dr. Simson, which, of course, was the only thing to do.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            I looked at him from the door of his room, for we were afraid to go near, lest we
            should disturb that blessed sleep. It looked like actual sleep, not the lethargy into
            which my wife told me he would sometimes fall. She told me everything in the next
            room, which communicated with his, rising now and then and going to the door of communication;
            and in this there was much that was very startling and confusing to the mind. It appeared
            that ever since the winter began—since it was early dark, and night had fallen before
            his return from school—he had been hearing voices among the ruins: at first only a
            groaning, he said, at which his pony was as much alarmed as he was, but by degrees
            a voice. The tears ran down my wife’s cheeks as she described to me how he would start
            up in the night and cry out, <span class="quote">“Oh, mother, let me in! oh, mother, let me in!”</span> with a pathos which rent her heart. And she sitting there all the time, only longing
            to do everything his heart could desire! But though she would try to soothe him, crying,
            <span class="quote">“You are at home, my darling. I am here. Don’t you know me? Your mother is here!”</span> he would only stare at her, and after a while spring up again with the same cry.
            At other times he would be quite reasonable, she said, asking eagerly when I was coming,
            but declaring that he must go with me as soon as I did so, <span class="quote">“to let them in.”</span> <span class="quote">“The doctor thinks his nervous system must have received a shock,”</span> my wife said. <span class="quote">“Oh, Henry, can it be that we have pushed him on too much with his work—a delicate
               boy like <span class="character">Roland</span>? And what is his work in comparison with his health? Even you would think little
               of honors or prizes if it hurt the boy’s health.”</span> Even I!—as if I were an inhuman father sacrificing my child to my ambition. But I
            would not increase her trouble by taking any notice. After awhile they persuaded me
            to lie down, to rest, and to eat, none of which things had been possible since I received
            their letters. The mere fact of being on the spot, of course, in itself was a great
            thing; and when I knew that I could be called in a moment, as soon as he was awake
            and wanted me, I felt capable, even in the dark, chill morning twilight, to snatch
            an hour or two’s sleep. As it happened, I was so worn out with the strain of anxiety,
            and he so quieted and consoled by knowing I had come, that I was not disturbed till
            the afternoon, when the twilight had again settled down. There was just daylight enough
            to see his face when I went to him; and what a change in a fortnight! He was paler
            and more worn, I thought, than even in those dreadful days in the plains before we
            left <span class="place">India</span>. His hair seemed to me to have grown long and lank; his eyes were like blazing lights
            projecting out of his white face. He got hold of my hand in a cold and tremulous clutch,
            and waved to everybody to go away. <span class="quote">“Go away—even mother,”</span> he said; <span class="quote">“go away.”</span> This went to her heart; for she did not like that even I should have more of the
            boy’s confidence than herself; but my wife has never been a woman to think of herself,
            and she left us alone. <span class="quote">“Are they all gone?”</span> he said eagerly. <span class="quote">“They would not let me speak. The doctor treated me as if I were a fool. You know
               I am not a fool, papa.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Yes, yes, my boy, I know. But you are ill, and quiet is so necessary. You are not
               only not a fool, <span class="character">Roland</span>, but you are reasonable and understand. When you are ill you must deny yourself;
               you must not do everything that you might do being well.”</span>
            
            He waved his thin hand with a sort of indignation. <span class="quote">“Then, father, I am not ill,”</span> he cried. <span class="quote">“Oh, I thought when you came you would not stop me,—you would see the sense of it!
               What do you think is the matter with me, all of you? Simson is well enough; but he
               is only a doctor. What do you think is the matter with me? I am no more ill than you
               are. A doctor, of course, he thinks you are ill the moment he looks at you—that’s
               what he’s there for—and claps you into bed.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Which is the best place for you at present, my dear boy.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“I made up my mind,”</span> cried the little fellow, <span class="quote">“that I would stand it till you came home. I said to myself, I won’t frighten mother
               and the girls. But now, father,”</span> he cried, half jumping out of bed, <span class="quote">“it’s not illness: it’s a secret.”</span>
            
            His eyes shone so wildly, his face was so swept with strong feeling, that my heart
            sank within me. It could be nothing but fever that did it, and fever had been so fatal.
            I got him into my arms to put him back into bed. <span class="quote">“<span class="character">Roland</span>,”</span> I said, humoring the poor child, which I knew was the only way, <span class="quote">“if you are going to tell me this secret to do any good, you know you must be quite
               quiet, and not excite yourself. If you excite yourself, I must not let you speak.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Yes, father,”</span> said the boy. He was quiet directly, like a man, as if he quite understood. When
            I had laid him back on his pillow, he looked up at me with that grateful, sweet look
            with which children, when they are ill, break one’s heart, the water coming into his
            eyes in his weakness. <span class="quote">“I was sure as soon as you were here you would know what to do,”</span> he said.
            
            <span class="quote">“To be sure, my boy. Now keep quiet, and tell it all out like a man.”</span> To think I was telling lies to my own child! for I did it only to humor him, thinking,
            poor little fellow, his brain was wrong.
            
            <span class="quote">“Yes, father. Father, there is some one in the park—some one that has been badly used.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Hush, my dear; you remember there is to be no excitement. Well, who is this somebody,
               and who has been ill-using him? We will soon put a stop to that.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“All,”</span> cried <span class="character">Roland</span>, <span class="quote">“but it is not so easy as you think. I don’t know who it is. It is just a cry. Oh,
               if you could hear it! It gets into my head in my sleep. I heard it as clear—as clear;
               and they think that I am dreaming, or raving perhaps,”</span> the boy said, with a sort of disdainful smile.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            <span class="quote">“Dreamed?—that!”</span> He was springing up again when he suddenly bethought himself, and lay down flat,
            with the same sort of smile on his face. <span class="quote">“The pony heard it, too,”</span> he said. <span class="quote">“She jumped as if she had been shot. If I had not grasped at the reins—for I was frightened,
               father—”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“No shame to you, my boy,”</span> said I, though I scarcely knew why.
            
            <span class="quote">“If I hadn’t held to her like a leech, she’d have pitched me over her head, and never
               drew breath till we were at the door. Did the pony dream it?”</span> he said, with a soft disdain, yet indulgence for my foolishness. Then he added slowly,
            <span class="quote">“It was only a cry the first time, and all the time before you went away. I wouldn’t
               tell you, for it was so wretched to be frightened. I thought it might be a hare or
               a rabbit snared, and I went in the morning and looked; but there was nothing. It was
               after you went I heard it really first; and this is what he says.”</span> He raised himself on his elbow close to me, and looked me in the face: <span class="quote">“‘Oh, mother, let me in! oh, mother, let me in!’”</span> As he said the words a mist came over his face, the mouth quivered, the soft features
            all melted and changed, and when he had ended these pitiful words, dissolved in a
            shower of heavy tears.

            <span class="quote">“This is very touching, <span class="character">Roland</span>,”</span> I said.
            
            <span class="quote">“Oh, if you had just heard it, father! I said to myself, if father heard it he would
               do something; but mamma, you know, she’s given over to Simson, and that fellow’s a
               doctor, and never thinks of anything but clapping you into bed.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“We must not blame Simson for being a doctor, <span class="character">Roland</span>.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“No, no,”</span> said my boy, with delightful toleration and indulgence; <span class="quote">“oh, no; that’s the good of him; that’s what he’s for; I know that. But you—you are
               different; you are just father; and you’ll do something—directly, papa, directly;
               this very night.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Surely,”</span> I said. <span class="quote">“No doubt it is some little lost child.”</span>
            
            He gave me a sudden, swift look, investigating my face as though to see whether, after
            all, this was everything my eminence as <span class="quote">“father”</span> came to,—no more than that. Then he got hold of my shoulder, clutching it with his
            thin hand. <span class="quote">“Look here,”</span> he said, with a quiver in his voice; <span class="quote">“suppose it wasn’t—living at all!”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“My dear boy, how then could you have heard it?”</span> I said.
            
            He turned away from me with a pettish exclamation,—<span class="quote">“As if you didn’t know better than that!”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Do you want to tell me it is a ghost?”</span> I said.
            
            <span class="character">Roland</span> withdrew his hand; his countenance assumed an aspect of great dignity and gravity;
            a slight quiver remained about his lips. <span class="quote">“Whatever it was—you always said we were not to call names. It was something—in trouble.
               Oh, father, in terrible trouble!”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“But, my boy,”</span> I said (I was at my wits’ end), <span class="quote">“if it was a child that was lost, or any poor human creature—but, <span class="character">Roland</span>, what do you want me to do?”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“I should know if I was you,”</span> said the child eagerly. <span class="quote">“That is what I always said to myself,—Father will know. Oh, papa, papa, to have to
               face it night after night, in such terrible, terrible trouble, and never to be able
               to do it any good! I don’t want to cry; it’s like a baby, I know; but what can I do
               else? Out there all by itself in the ruin, and nobody to help it! I can’t bear it!
               I can’t bear it!”</span> cried my generous boy. And in his weakness he burst out, after many attempts to restrain
            it, into a great childish fit of sobbing and tears.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            <span class="quote">“It will be there now!—it will be there all the night! Oh, think, papa,—think if it
               was me! I can’t rest for thinking of it. Don’t!”</span> he cried, putting away my hand,—<span class="quote">“don’t! You go and help it, and mother can take care of me.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“But, <span class="character">Roland</span>, what can I do?”</span>
            
            My boy opened his eyes, which were large with weakness and fever, and gave me a smile
            such, I think, as sick children only know the secret of. <span class="quote">“I was sure you would know as soon as you came. I always said, Father will know. And
               mother,”</span> he cried, with a softening of repose upon his face, his limbs relaxing, his form
            sinking with a luxurious ease in his bed,—<span class="quote">“mother can come and take care of me.”</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            It was then I remembered suddenly the looks of the men when they turned to take the
            brougham to the stables in the dark that morning. They had not liked it, and the horses
            had not liked it. I remembered that even in my anxiety about <span class="character">Roland</span> I had heard them tearing along the avenue back to the stables, and had made a memorandum
            mentally that I must speak of it. It seemed to me that the best thing I could do was
            to go to the stables now and make a few inquiries. It is impossible to fathom the
            minds of rustics; there might be some devilry of practical joking, for anything I
            knew; or they might have some interest in getting up a bad reputation for the <span class="place">Brentwood</span> avenue. It was getting dark by the time I went out, and nobody who knows the country
            will need to be told how black is the darkness of a November night under high laurel-bushes
            and yew-trees. I walked into the heart of the shrubberies two or three times, not
            seeing a step before me, till I came out upon the broader carriage-road, where the
            trees opened a little, and there was a faint gray glimmer of sky visible, under which
            the great limes and elms stood darkling like ghosts; but it grew black again as I
            approached the corner where the ruins lay. Both eyes and ears were on the alert, as
            may be supposed; but I could see nothing in the absolute gloom, and, so far as I can
            recollect, I heard nothing. Nevertheless there came a strong impression upon me that
            somebody was there. It is a sensation which most people have felt. I have seen when
            it has been strong enough to awake me out of sleep, the sense of some one looking
            at me. I suppose my imagination had been affected by <span class="character">Roland</span>’s story; and the mystery of the darkness is always full of suggestions. I stamped
            my feet violently on the gravel to rouse myself, and called out sharply, <span class="quote">“Who’s there?”</span> Nobody answered, nor did I expect any one to answer, but the impression had been
            made. I was so foolish that I did not like to look back, but went sideways, keeping
            an eye on the gloom behind. It was with great relief that I spied the light in the
            stables, making a sort of oasis in the darkness. I walked very quickly into the midst
            of that lighted and cheerful place, and thought the clank of the groom’s pail one
            of the pleasantest sounds I had ever heard. The coachman was the head of this little
            colony, and it was to his house I went to pursue my investigations. He was a native
            of the district, and had taken care of the place in the absence of the family for
            years; it was impossible but that he must know everything that was going on, and all
            the traditions of the place. The men, I could see, eyed me anxiously when I thus appeared
            at such an hour among them, and followed me with their eyes to Jarvis’s house, where
            he lived alone with his old wife, their children being all married and out in the
            world. Mrs. Jarvis met me with anxious questions. How was the poor young gentleman?
            But the others knew, I could see by their faces, that not even this was the foremost
            thing in my mind.
            
            
            
            <span class="quote">“Noises?—ou ay, there’ll be noises,—the wind in the trees, and the water soughing
               down the glen. As for tramps, Cornel, no, there’s little o’ that kind o’ cattle about
               here; and Merran at the gate’s a careful body.”</span> Jarvis moved about with some embarrassment from one leg to another as he spoke. He
            kept in the shade, and did not look at me more than he could help. Evidently his mind
            was perturbed, and he had reasons for keeping his own counsel. His wife sat by, giving
            him a quick look now and then, but saying nothing. The kitchen was very snug and warm
            and bright,—as different as could be from the chill and mystery of the night outside.
            
            <span class="quote">“I think you are trifling with me, Jarvis,”</span> I said.
            
            <span class="quote">“Triflin’, Cornel? No me. What would I trifle for? If the deevil himsel was in the
               auld hoose, I have no interest in ’t one way or another—”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Sandy, hold your peace!”</span> cried his wife imperatively.
            
            <span class="quote">“And what am I to hold my peace for, wi’ the Cornel standing there asking a’ thae
               questions? I’m saying, if the deevil himsel—”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“And I’m telling ye hold your peace!”</span> cried the woman, in great excitement. <span class="quote">“Dark November weather and lang nichts, and us that ken a’ we ken. How daur ye name—a
               name that shouldna be spoken?”</span> She threw down her stocking and got up, also in great agitation. <span class="quote">“I tellt ye you never could keep it. It’s no a thing that will hide, and the haill
               toun kens as weel as you or me. Tell the Cornel straight out—or see, I’ll do it. I
               dinna hold wi’ your secrets, and a secret that the haill toun kens!”</span> She snapped her fingers with an air of large disdain. As for Jarvis, ruddy and big
            as he was, he shrank to nothing before this decided woman. He repeated to her two
            or three times her own adjuration, <span class="quote">“Hold your peace!”</span> then, suddenly changing his tone, cried out, <span class="quote">“Tell him then, confound ye! I’ll wash my hands o’t. If a’ the ghosts in Scotland
               were in the auld hoose, is that ony concern o’ mine?”</span>
            
            After this I elicited without much difficulty the whole story. In the opinion of the
            Jarvises, and of everybody about, the certainty that the place was haunted was beyond
            all doubt. As Sandy and his wife warmed to the tale, one tripping up another in their
            eagerness to tell everything, it gradually developed as distinct a superstition as
            I ever heard, and not without poetry and pathos. How long it was since the voice had
            been heard first, nobody could tell with certainty. Jarvis’s opinion was that his
            father, who had been coachman at <span class="place">Brentwood</span> before him, had never heard anything about it, and that the whole thing had arisen
            within the last ten years, since the complete dismantling of the old house; which
            was a wonderfully modern date for a tale so well authenticated. According to these
            witnesses, and to several whom I questioned afterwards, and who were all in perfect
            agreement, it was only in the months of November and December that <span class="quote">“the visitation”</span> occurred. During these months, the darkest of the year, scarcely a night passed without
            the recurrence of these inexplicable cries. Nothing, it was said, had ever been seen,—at
            least, nothing that could be identified. Some people, bolder or more imaginative than
            the others, had seen the darkness moving, Mrs. Jarvis said, with unconscious poetry.
            It began when night fell, and continued, at intervals, till day broke. Very often
            it was only all inarticulate cry and moaning, but sometimes the words which had taken
            possession of my poor boy’s fancy had been distinctly audible,—<span class="quote">“Oh, mother, let me in!”</span> The Jarvises were not aware that there had ever been any investigation into it. The
            estate of <span class="place">Brentwood</span> had lapsed into the hands of a distant branch of the family, who had lived but little
            there; and of the many people who had taken it, as I had done, few had remained through
            two Decembers. And nobody had taken the trouble to make a very close examination into
            the facts. <span class="quote">“No, no,”</span> Jarvis said, shaking his head, <span class="quote">“No, no, Cornel. Wha wad set themsels up for a laughin’-stock to a’ the country-side,
               making a wark about a ghost? Naebody believes in ghosts. It bid to be the wind in
               the trees, the last gentleman said, or some effec’ o’ the water wrastlin’ among the
               rocks. He said it was a’ quite easy explained; but he gave up the hoose. And when
               you cam, Cornel, we were awfu’ anxious you should never hear. What for should I have
               spoiled the bargain and hairmed the property for no-thing?”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Do you call my child’s life nothing?”</span> I said in the trouble of the moment, unable to restrain myself. <span class="quote">“And instead of telling this all to me, you have told it to him,—to a delicate boy,
               a child unable to sift evidence or judge for himself, a tender-hearted young creature—”</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            <span class="quote">“Cornel,”</span> said Jarvis solemnly, <span class="quote">“and she’ll bear me witness,—the young gentleman never heard a word from me—no, nor
               from either groom or gardener; I’ll gie ye my word for that. In the first place, he’s
               no a lad that invites ye to talk. There are some that are, and some that arena. Some
               will draw ye on, till ye’ve tellt them a’ the clatter of the toun, and a’ ye ken,
               and whiles mair. But Maister <span class="character">Roland</span>, his mind’s fu’ of his books. He’s aye civil and kind, and a fine lad; but no that
               sort. And ye see it’s for a’ our interest, Cornel, that you should stay at <span class="place">Brentwood</span>. I took it upon me mysel to pass the word,—‘No a syllable to Maister <span class="character">Roland</span>, nor to the young leddies—no a syllable.’ The women-servants, that have little reason
               to be out at night, ken little or nothing about it. And some think it grand to have
               a ghost so long as they’re no in the way of coming across it. If you had been tellt
               the story to begin with, maybe ye would have thought so yourself.”</span>
            
            This was true enough, though it did not throw any light upon my perplexity. If we
            had heard of it to start with, it is possible that all the family would have considered
            the possession of a ghost a distinct advantage. It is the fashion of the times. We
            never think what a risk it is to play with young imaginations, but cry out, in the
            fashionable jargon, <span class="quote">“A ghost!—nothing else was wanted to make it perfect.”</span> I should not have been above this myself. I should have smiled, of course, at the
            idea of the ghost at all, but then to feel that it was mine would have pleased my
            vanity. Oh, yes, I claim no exemption. The girls would have been delighted. I could
            fancy their eagerness, their interest, and excitement. No; if we had been told, it
            would have done no good,—we should have made the bargain all the more eagerly, the
            fools that we are. <span class="quote">“And there has been no attempt to investigate it,”</span> I said, <span class="quote">“to see what it really is?”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Eh, Cornel,”</span> said the coachman’s wife, <span class="quote">“wha would investigate, as ye call it, a thing that nobody believes in? Ye would be
               the laughin’-stock of a’ the country-side, as my man says.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“But you believe in it,”</span> I said, turning upon her hastily. The woman was taken by surprise. She made a step
            backward out of my way.
            
            <span class="quote">“Lord, Cornel, how ye frichten a body! Me!—there’s awfu’ strange things in this world.
               An unlearned person doesna ken what to think. But the minister and the gentry they
               just laugh in your face. Inquire into the thing that is not! Na, na, we just let it
               be.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Come with me, Jarvis,”</span> I said hastily, <span class="quote">“and we’ll make an attempt at least. Say nothing to the men or to anybody. I’ll come
               back after dinner, and we’ll make a serious attempt to see what it is, if it is anything.
               If I hear it,—which I doubt,—you may be sure I shall never rest till I make it out.
               Be ready for me about ten o’clock.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Me, Cornel!”</span> Jarvis said, in a faint voice. I had not been looking at him in my own preoccupation,
            but when I did so, I found that the greatest change had come over the fat and ruddy
            coachman. <span class="quote">“Me, Cornel!”</span> he repeated, wiping the perspiration from his brow. His ruddy face hung in flabby
            folds, his knees knocked together, his voice seemed half extinguished in his throat.
            Then he began to rub his hands and smile upon me in a deprecating, imbecile way. <span class="quote">“There’s nothing I wouldna do to pleasure ye, Cornel,”</span> taking a step further back. <span class="quote">“I’m sure she kens I’ve aye said I never had to do with a mair fair, weel-spoken gentleman—”</span> Here Jarvis came to a pause, again looking at me, rubbing his hands.
            
            <span class="quote">“Well?”</span> I said.
            
            <span class="quote">“But eh, sir!”</span> he went on, with the same imbecile yet insinuating smile, <span class="quote">“if ye’ll reflect that I am no used to my feet. With a horse atween my legs, or the
               reins in my hand, I’m maybe nae worse than other men; but on fit, Cornel—It’s no the—bogles—but
               I’ve been cavalry, ye see,”</span> with a little hoarse laugh, <span class="quote">“a’ my life. To face a thing ye dinna understan’—on your feet, Cornel.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Well, sir, if I do it,”</span> said I tartly, <span class="quote">“why shouldn’t you?”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Eh, Cornel, there’s an awfu’ difference. In the first place, ye tramp about the haill
               countryside, and think naething of it; but a walk tires me mair than a hunard miles’
               drive; and then ye’re a gentleman, and do your ain pleasure; and you’re no so auld
               as me; and it’s for your ain bairn, ye see, Cornel; and then—”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“He believes in it, Cornel, and you dinna believe in it,”</span> the woman said.
            
            <span class="quote">“Will you come with me?”</span> I said, turning to her.
            
            She jumped back, upsetting her chair in her bewilderment. <span class="quote">“Me!”</span> with a scream, and then fell into a sort of hysterical laugh. <span class="quote">“I wouldna say but what I would go; but what would the folk say to hear of Cornel
               Mortimer with an auld silly woman at his heels?”</span>
            
            The suggestion made me laugh too, though I had little inclination for it. <span class="quote">“I’m sorry you have so little spirit, Jarvis,”</span> I said. <span class="quote">“I must find some one else, I suppose.”</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            And it will be thought very strange, but it would be weak not to add, that I myself,
            though bent on the investigation I have spoken of, pledged to <span class="character">Roland</span> to carry it out, and feeling that my boy’s health, perhaps his life, depended on
            the result of my inquiry,—I felt the most unaccountable reluctance to pass these ruins
            on my way home. My curiosity was intense; and yet it was all my mind could do to pull
            my body along. I daresay the scientific people would describe it the other way, and
            attribute my cowardice to the state of my stomach. I went on; but if I had followed
            my impulse, I should have turned and bolted. Everything in me seemed to cry out against
            it: my heart thumped, my pulses all began, like sledge-hammers, beating against my
            ears and every sensitive part. It was very dark, as I have said; the old house, with
            its shapeless tower, loomed a heavy mass through the darkness, which was only not
            entirely so solid as itself. On the other hand, the great dark cedars of which we
            were so proud seemed to fill up the night. My foot strayed out of the path in my confusion
            and the gloom together, and I brought myself up with a cry as I felt myself knock
            against something solid. What was it? The contact with hard stone and lime and prickly
            bramble-bushes restored me a little to myself. <span class="quote">“Oh, it’s only the old gable,”</span> I said aloud, with a little laugh to reassure myself. The rough feeling of the stones
            reconciled me. As I groped about thus, I shook off my visionary folly. What so easily
            explained as that I should have strayed from the path in the darkness? This brought
            me back to common existence, as if I had been shaken by a wise hand out of all the
            silliness of superstition. How silly it was, after all! What did it matter which path
            I took? I laughed again, this time with better heart, when suddenly, in a moment,
            the blood was chilled in my veins, a shiver stole along my spine, my faculties seemed
            to forsake me. Close by me, at my side, at my feet, there was a sigh. No, not a groan,
            not a moaning, not anything so tangible,—a perfectly soft, faint, inarticulate sigh.
            I sprang back, and my heart stopped beating. Mistaken! no, mistake was impossible.
            I heard it as clearly as I hear myself speak; a long, soft, weary sigh, as if drawn
            to the utmost, and emptying out a load of sadness that filled the breast. To hear
            this in the solitude, in the dark, in the night (though it was still early), had an
            effect which I cannot describe. I feel it now,—something cold creeping over me, up
            into my hair, and down to my feet, which refused to move. I cried out, with a trembling
            voice, <span class="quote">“Who is there?”</span> as I had done before; but there was no reply.
            
            I got home I don’t quite know how; but in my mind there was no longer any indifference
            as to the thing, whatever it was, that haunted these ruins. My scepticism disappeared
            like a mist. I was as firmly determined that there was something as <span class="character">Roland</span> was. I did not for a moment pretend to myself that it was possible I could be deceived;
            there were movements and noises which I understood all about,—cracklings of small
            branches in the frost, and little rolls of gravel on the path, such as have a very
            eerie sound sometimes, and perplex you with wonder as to who has done it, when there
            is no real mystery; but I assure you all these little movements of nature don’t affect
            you one bit when there is something. I understood them. I did not understand the sigh.
            That was not simple nature; there was meaning in it, feeling, the soul of a creature
            invisible. This is the thing that human nature trembles at,—a creature invisible,
            yet with sensations, feelings, a power somehow of expressing itself. I had not the
            same sense of unwillingness to turn my back upon the scene of the mystery which I
            had experienced in going to the stables; but I almost ran home, impelled by eagerness
            to get everything done that had to be done, in order to apply myself to finding it
            out. Bagley was in the hall as usual when I went in. He was always there in the afternoon,
            always with the appearance of perfect occupation, yet, so far as I know, never doing
            anything. The door was open, so that I hurried in without any pause, breathless; but
            the sight of his calm regard, as he came to help me off with my overcoat, subdued
            me in a moment. Anything out of the way, anything incomprehensible, faded to nothing
            in the presence of Bagley. You saw and wondered how he was made: the parting of his
            hair, the tie of his white neckcloth, the fit of his trousers, all perfect as works
            of art; but you could see how they were done, which makes all the difference. I flung
            myself upon him, so to speak, without waiting to note the extreme unlikeness of the
            man to anything of the kind I meant. <span class="quote">“Bagley,”</span> I said, <span class="quote">“I want you to come out with me to-night to watch for—”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Poachers, Colonel?”</span> he said, a gleam of pleasure running all over him.
            
            <span class="quote">“No, Bagley; a great deal worse,”</span> I cried.
            
            <span class="quote">“Yes, Colonel; at what hour, sir?”</span> the man said; but then I had not told him what it was.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            We went, so far as I could guess, exactly as I had come; when I heard that sigh. The
            darkness, however, was so complete that all marks, as of trees or paths, disappeared.
            One moment we felt our feet on the gravel, another sinking noiselessly into the slippery
            grass, that was all. I had shut up my lantern, not wishing to scare any one, whoever
            it might be. Bagley followed, it seemed to me, exactly in my footsteps as I made my
            way, as I supposed, towards the mass of the ruined house. We seemed to take a long
            time groping along seeking this; the squash of the wet soil under our feet was the
            only thing that marked our progress. After a while I stood still to see, or rather
            feel, where we were. The darkness was very still, but no stiller than is usual in
            a winter’s night. The sounds I have mentioned—the crackling of twigs, the roll of
            a pebble, the sound of some rustle in the dead leaves, or creeping creature on the
            grass—were audible when you listened, all mysterious enough when your mind is disengaged,
            but to me cheering now as signs of the livingness of nature, even in the death of
            the frost. As we stood still there came up from the trees in the glen the prolonged
            hoot of an owl. Bagley started with alarm, being in a state of general nervousness,
            and not knowing what he was afraid of. But to me the sound was encouraging and pleasant,
            being so comprehensible.
            
            <span class="quote">“An owl,”</span> I said, under my breath. <span class="quote">“Y—es, Colonel,”</span> said Bagley, his teeth chattering. We stood still about five minutes, while it broke
            into the still brooding of the air, the sound widening out in circles, dying upon
            the darkness. This sound, which is not a cheerful one, made me almost gay. It was
            natural, and relieved the tension of the mind. I moved on with new courage, my nervous
            excitement calming down.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            I went myself to the other side of the wall, keeping close to it. The light shook
            in Bagley’s hand, but, tremulous though it was, shone out through the vacant door,
            one oblong block of light marking all the crumbling corners and hanging masses of
            foliage. Was that something dark huddled in a heap by the side of it? I pushed forward
            across the light in the door-way, and fell upon it with my hands; but it was only
            a juniper-bush growing close against the wall. Meanwhile, the sight of my figure crossing
            the door-way had brought Bagley’s nervous excitement to a height: he flew at me, gripping
            my shoulder. <span class="quote">“I’ve got him, Colonel! I’ve got him!”</span> he cried, with a voice of sudden exultation. He thought it was a man, and was at
            once relieved. But at that moment the voice burst forth again between us, at our feet,—more
            close to us than any separate being could be. He dropped off from me, and fell against
            the wall, his jaw dropping as if he were dying. I suppose, at the same moment, he
            saw that it was me whom he had clutched. I, for my part, had scarcely more command
            of myself. I snatched the light out of his hand, and flashed it all about me wildly.
            Nothing,—the juniper-bush which I thought I had never seen before, the heavy growth
            of the glistening ivy, the brambles waving. It was close to my ears now, crying, crying,
            pleading as if for life. Either I heard the same words <span class="character">Roland</span> had heard, or else, in my excitement, his imagination got possession of mine. The
            voice went on, growing into distinct articulation, but wavering about, now from one
            point, now from another, as if the owner of it were moving slowly back and forward.
            <span class="quote">“Mother! mother!”</span> and then an outburst of wailing. As my mind steadied, getting accustomed (as one’s
            mind gets accustomed to anything), it seemed to me as if some uneasy, miserable creature
            was pacing up and down before a closed door. Sometimes—but that must have been excitement—I
            thought I heard a sound like knocking, and then another burst, <span class="quote">“Oh, mother! mother!”</span> All this close, close to the space where I was standing with my lantern, now before
            me, now behind me: a creature restless, unhappy, moaning, crying, before the vacant
            door-way, which no one could either shut or open more.
            
            <span class="quote">“Do you hear it, Bagley? do you hear what it is saying?”</span> I cried, stepping in through the door-way. He was lying against the wall, his eyes
            glazed, half dead with terror. He made a motion of his lips as if to answer me, but
            no sounds came; then lifted his hand with a curious imperative movement as if ordering
            me to be silent and listen. And how long I did so I cannot tell. It began to have
            an interest, an exciting hold upon me, which I could not describe. It seemed to call
            up visibly a scene any one could understand,—a something shut out, restlessly wandering
            to and fro; sometimes the voice dropped, as if throwing itself down, sometimes wandered
            off a few paces, growing sharp and clear. <span class="quote">“Oh, mother, let me in! oh, mother, mother, let me in! oh, let me in!”</span> Every word was clear to me. No wonder the boy had gone wild with pity. I tried to
            steady my mind upon <span class="character">Roland</span>, upon his conviction that I could do something, but my head swam with the excitement,
            even when I partially overcame the terror. At last the words died away, and there
            was a sound of sobs and moaning. I cried out, <span class="quote">“In the name of God, who are you?”</span> with a kind of feeling in my mind that to use the name of God was profane, seeing
            that I did not believe in ghosts or anything supernatural; but I did it all the same,
            and waited, my heart giving a leap of terror lest there should be a reply. Why this
            should have been I cannot tell, but I had a feeling that if there was an answer it
            would be more than I could bear. But there was no answer; the moaning went on, and
            then, as if it had been real, the voice rose a little higher again, the words recommenced,
            <span class="quote">“Oh, mother, let me in! oh, mother, let me in!”</span> with an expression that was heart-breaking to hear.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            <span class="quote">“You’ve got an epidemic in your house, Colonel,”</span> Simson said to me next morning. <span class="quote">“What’s the meaning of it all? Here’s your butler raving about a voice. This will
               never do, you know; and so far as I can make out, you are in it too.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Yes, I am in it, Doctor. I thought I had better speak to you. Of course you are treating
               <span class="character">Roland</span> all right, but the boy is not raving, he is as sane as you or me. It’s all true.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“As sane as—I—or you. I never thought the boy insane. He’s got cerebral excitement,
               fever. I don’t know what you’ve got. There’s something very queer about the look of
               your eyes.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Come,”</span> said I, <span class="quote">“you can’t put us all to bed, you know. You had better listen and hear the symptoms
               in full.”</span>
            
            The Doctor shrugged his shoulders, but he listened to me patiently. He did not believe
            a word of the story, that was clear; but he heard it all from beginning to end. <span class="quote">“My dear fellow,”</span> he said, <span class="quote">“the boy told me just the same. It’s an epidemic. When one person falls a victim to
               this sort of thing, it’s as safe as can be,—there’s always two or three.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Then how do you account for it?”</span> I said.
            
            <span class="quote">“Oh, account for it!—that’s a different matter; there’s no accounting for the freaks
               our brains are subject to. If it’s delusion, if it’s some trick of the echoes or the
               winds,—some phonetic disturbance or other—”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Come with me to-night, and judge for yourself,”</span> I said.
            
            Upon this he laughed aloud, then said, <span class="quote">“That’s not such a bad idea; but it would ruin me forever if it were known that <span class="character">John</span> Simson was ghost-hunting.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“There it is,”</span> said I; <span class="quote">“you dart down on us who are unlearned with your phonetic disturbances, but you daren’t
               examine what the thing really is for fear of being laughed at. That’s science!”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“It’s not science,—it’s common-sense,”</span> said the Doctor. <span class="quote">“The thing has delusion on the front of it. It is encouraging an unwholesome tendency
               even to examine. What good could come of it? Even if I am convinced, I shouldn’t believe.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“I should have said so yesterday; and I don’t want you to be convinced or to believe,”</span> said I. <span class="quote">“If you prove it to be a delusion, I shall be very much obliged to you for one. Come;
               somebody must go with me.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“You are cool,”</span> said the Doctor. <span class="quote">“You’ve disabled this poor fellow of yours, and made him—on that point—a lunatic for
               life; and now you want to disable me. But, for once, I’ll do it. To save appearance,
               if you’ll give me a bed, I’ll come over after my last rounds.”</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            That night at eleven I met Simson at the gate. He had come by train, and I let him
            in gently myself. I had been so much absorbed in the coming experiment that I passed
            the ruins in going to meet him, almost without thought, if you can understand that.
            I had my lantern; and he showed me a coil of taper which he had ready for use. <span class="quote">“There is nothing like light,”</span> he said, in his scoffing tone. It was a very still night, scarcely a sound, but not
            so dark. We could keep the path without difficulty as we went along. As we approached
            the spot we could hear a low moaning, broken occasionally by a bitter cry. <span class="quote">“Perhaps that is your voice,”</span> said the Doctor; <span class="quote">“I thought it must be something of the kind. That’s a poor brute caught in some of
               these infernal traps of yours; you’ll find it among the bushes somewhere.”</span> I said nothing. I felt no particular fear, but a triumphant satisfaction in what
            was to follow. I led him to the spot where Bagley and I had stood on the previous
            night. All was silent as a winter night could be,—so silent that we heard far off
            the sound of the horses in the stables, the shutting of a window at the house. Simson
            lighted his taper and went peering about, poking into all the corners. We looked like
            two conspirators lying in wait for some unfortunate traveller; but not a sound broke
            the quiet. The moaning had stopped before we came up; a star or two shone over us
            in the sky, looking down as if surprised at our strange proceedings. Dr. Simson did
            nothing but utter subdued laughs under his breath. <span class="quote">“I thought as much,”</span> he said. <span class="quote">“It is just the same with tables and all other kinds of ghostly apparatus; a sceptic’s
               presence stops everything. When I am present nothing ever comes off. How long do you
               think it will be necessary to stay here? Oh, I don’t complain; only when you are satisfied,
               I am—quite.”</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            We walked home very silent afterwards. It was only when we were in sight of the house
            that I said, <span class="quote">“What do you think of it?”</span> <span class="quote">“I can’t tell what to think of it,”</span> he said quickly. He took—though he was a very temperate man—not the claret I was
            going to offer him, but some brandy from the tray, and swallowed it almost undiluted.
            <span class="quote">“Mind you, I don’t believe a word of it,”</span> he said, when he had lighted his candle; <span class="quote">“but I can’t tell what to think,”</span> he turned round to add, when he was half-way upstairs.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            Next morning Simson was out before breakfast, and came in with evident signs of the
            damp grass on his boots, and a look of worry and weariness, which did not say much
            for the night he had passed. He improved a little after breakfast, and visited his
            two patients,—for Bagley was still an invalid. I went out with him on his way to the
            train, to hear what he had to say about the boy. <span class="quote">“He is going on very well,”</span> he said; <span class="quote">“there are no complications as yet. But mind you, that’s not a boy to be trifled with,
               Mortimer. Not a word to him about last night.”</span> I had to tell him then of my last interview with <span class="character">Roland</span>, and of the impossible demand he had made upon me, by which, though he tried to laugh,
            he was much discomposed, as I could see. <span class="quote">“We must just perjure ourselves all round,”</span> he said, <span class="quote">“and swear you exorcised it;”</span> but the man was too kind-hearted to be satisfied with that. <span class="quote">“It’s frightfully serious for you, Mortimer. I can’t laugh as I should like to. I
               wish I saw a way out of it, for your sake. By the way,”</span> he added shortly, <span class="quote">“didn’t you notice that juniper-bush on the left-hand side?”</span> <span class="quote">“There was one on the right hand of the door. I noticed you made that mistake last
               night.”</span> <span class="quote">“Mistake!”</span> he cried, with a curious low laugh, pulling up the collar of his coat as though he
            felt the cold,—<span class="quote">“there’s no juniper there this morning, left or right. Just go and see.”</span> As he stepped into the train a few minutes after, he looked back upon me and beckoned
            me for a parting word. <span class="quote">“I’m coming back to-night,”</span> he said.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            <span class="quote">“Come away, Colonel Mortimer,”</span> he said; <span class="quote">“I’m all the more glad to see you, that I feel it’s a good sign for the boy. He’s
               doing well?—God be praised,—and the Lord bless him and keep him. He has many a poor
               body’s prayers, and that can do nobody harm.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“He will need them all, <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span>,”</span> I said, <span class="quote">“and your counsel too.”</span> And I told him the story,—more than I had told Simson. The old clergyman listened
            to me with many suppressed exclamations, and at the end the water stood in his eyes.
            
            <span class="quote">“That’s just beautiful,”</span> he said. <span class="quote">“I do not mind to have heard anything like it; it’s as fine as Burns when he wished
               deliverance to one—that is prayed for in no kirk. Ay, ay! so he would have you console
               the poor lost spirit? God bless the boy! There’s something more than common in that,
               Colonel Mortimer. And also the faith of him in his father!—I would like to put that
               into a sermon.”</span> Then the old gentleman gave me an alarmed look, and said, <span class="quote">“No, no; I was not meaning a sermon; but I must write it down for the ‘Children’s
               Record.’”</span> I saw the thought that passed through his mind. Either he thought, or he feared I
            would think, of a funeral sermon. You may believe this did not make me more cheerful.
            
            I can scarcely say that <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span> gave me any advice. How could any one advise on such a subject? But he said, <span class="quote">“I think I’ll come too. I’m an old man; I’m less liable to be frightened than those
               that are further off the world unseen. It behooves me to think of my own journey there.
               I’ve no cut-and-dry beliefs on the subject. I’ll come too; and maybe at the moment
               the Lord will put into our heads what to do.”</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            The road to the station and the village lay through the glen, not by the ruins; but
            though the sunshine and the fresh air, and the beauty of the trees, and the sound
            of the water were all very soothing to the spirits, my mind was so full of my own
            subject that I could not refrain from turning to the right hand as I got to the top
            of the glen, and going straight to the place which I may call the scene of all my
            thoughts. It was lying full in the sunshine, like all the rest of the world. The ruined
            gable looked due east, and in the present aspect of the sun the light streamed down
            through the door-way as our lantern had done, throwing a flood of light upon the damp
            grass beyond. There was a strange suggestion in the open door,—so futile, a kind of
            emblem of vanity: all free around, so that you could go where you pleased, and yet
            that semblance of an enclosure,—that way of entrance, unnecessary, leading to nothing.
            And why any creature should pray and weep to get in—to nothing, or be kept out—by
            nothing, you could not dwell upon it, or it made your brain go round. I remembered,
            however, what Simson said about the juniper, with a little smile on my own mind as
            to the inaccuracy of recollection which even a scientific man will be guilty of. I
            could see now the light of my lantern gleaming upon the wet glistening surface of
            the spiky leaves at the right hand,—and he ready to go to the stake for it that it
            was the left! I went round to make sure. And then I saw what he had said. Right or
            left there was no juniper at all! I was confounded by this, though it was entirely
            a matter of detail nothing at all,—a bush of brambles waving, the grass growing up
            to the very walls. But after all, though it gave me a shock for a moment, what did
            that matter? There were marks as if a number of footsteps had been up and down in
            front of the door, but these might have been our steps; and all was bright and peaceful
            and still. I poked about the other ruin—the larger ruins of the old house—for some
            time, as I had done before. There were marks upon the grass here and there—I could
            not call them footsteps—all about; but that told for nothing one way or another. I
            had examined the ruined rooms closely the first day. They were half filled up with
            soil and debris, withered brackens and bramble,—no refuge for any one there. It vexed
            me that Jarvis should see me coming from that spot when he came up to me for his orders.
            I don’t know whether my nocturnal expeditions had got wind among the servants, but
            there was a significant look in his face. Something in it I felt was like my own sensation
            when Simson in the midst of his scepticism was struck dumb. Jarvis felt satisfied
            that his veracity had been put beyond question. I never spoke to a servant of mine
            in such a peremptory tone before. I sent him away <span class="quote">“with a flea in his lug,”</span> as the man described it afterwards. Interference of any kind was intolerable to me
            at such a moment.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            Simson came out to dinner, and when the house was all still, and most of the servants
            in bed, we went out and met <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span>, as we had appointed, at the head of the glen. Simson, for his part, was disposed
            to scoff at the Doctor. <span class="quote">“If there are to be any spells, you know, I’ll cut the whole concern,”</span> he said. I did not make him any reply. I had not invited him; he could go or come
            as he pleased. He was very talkative, far more so than suited my humor, as we went
            on. <span class="quote">“One thing is certain, you know; there must be some human agency,”</span> he said. <span class="quote">“It is all bosh about apparitions. I never have investigated the laws of sound to
               any great extent, and there’s a great deal in ventriloquism that we don’t know much
               about.”</span> <span class="quote">“If it’s the same to you,”</span> I said, <span class="quote">“I wish you’d keep all that to yourself, Simson. It doesn’t suit my state of mind.”</span> <span class="quote">“Oh, I hope I know how to respect idiosyncrasy,”</span> he said. The very tone of his voice irritated me beyond measure. These scientific
            fellows, I wonder people put up with them as they do, when you have no mind for their
            cold-blooded confidence. <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span> met us about eleven o’clock, the same time as on the previous night. He was a large
            man, with a venerable countenance and white hair,—old, but in full vigor, and thinking
            less of a cold night walk than many a younger man. He had his lantern, as I had. We
            were fully provided with means of lighting the place, and we were all of us resolute
            men. We had a rapid consultation as we went up, and the result was that we divided
            to different posts. <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span> remained inside the wall—if you can call that inside where there was no wall but
            one. Simson placed himself on the side next the ruins, so as to intercept any communication
            with the old house, which was what his mind was fixed upon. I was posted on the other
            side. To say that nothing could come near without being seen was self-evident. It
            had been so also on the previous night. Now, with our three lights in the midst of
            the darkness, the whole place seemed illuminated. <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span>’s lantern, which was a large one, without any means of shutting up,—an old-fashioned
            lantern with a pierced and ornamental top,—shone steadily, the rays shooting out of
            it upward into the gloom. He placed it on the grass, where the middle of the room,
            if this had been a room, would have been. The usual effect of the light streaming
            out of the door-way was prevented by the illumination which Simson and I on either
            side supplied. With these differences, everything seemed as on the previous night.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            We were all perfectly still till the first outburst was exhausted, as I knew, by experience,
            it would be. <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span>, to whom it was new, was quite motionless on the other side of the wall, as we were
            in our places. My heart had remained almost at its usual beating during the voice.
            I was used to it; it did not rouse all my pulses as it did at first. But just as it
            threw itself sobbing at the door (I cannot use other words), there suddenly came something
            which sent the blood coursing through my veins, and my heart into my mouth. It was
            a voice inside the wall,—the minister’s well-known voice. I would have been prepared
            for it in any kind of adjuration, but I was not prepared for what I heard. It came
            out with a sort of stammering, as if too much moved for utterance. <span class="quote">“Willie, Willie! Oh, God preserve us! is it you?”</span>
            
            These simple words had an effect upon me that the voice of the invisible creature
            had ceased to have. I thought the old man, whom I had brought into this danger, had
            gone mad with terror. I made a dash round to the other side of the wall, half crazed
            myself with the thought. He was standing where I had left him, his shadow thrown vague
            and large upon the grass by the lantern which stood at his feet. I lifted my own light
            to see his face as I rushed forward. He was very pale, his eyes wet and glistening,
            his mouth quivering with parted lips. He neither saw nor heard me. We that had gone
            through this experience before, had crouched towards each other to get a little strength
            to bear it. But he was not even aware that I was there. His whole being seemed absorbed
            in anxiety and tenderness. He held out his hands, which trembled, but it seemed to
            me with eagerness, not fear. He went on speaking all the time. <span class="quote">“Willie, if it is you,—and it’s you, if it is not a delusion of Satan,—Willie, lad!
               why come ye here frighting them that know you not? Why came ye not to me?”</span>
            
            He seemed to wait for an answer. When his voice ceased, his countenance, every line
            moving, continued to speak. Simson gave me another terrible shock, stealing into the
            open door-way with his light, as much awe-stricken, as wildly curious, as I. But the
            minister resumed, without seeing Simson, speaking to some one else. His voice took
            a tone of expostulation:—
            
            <span class="quote">“Is this right to come here? Your mother’s gone with your name on her lips. Do you
               think she would ever close her door on her own lad? Do ye think the Lord will close
               the door, ye faint-hearted creature? No!—I forbid ye! I forbid ye!”</span> cried the old man. The sobbing voice had begun to resume its cries. He made a step
            forward, calling out the last words in a voice of command. <span class="quote">“I forbid ye! Cry out no more to man. Go home, ye wandering spirit! go home! Do you
               hear me?—me that christened ye, that have struggled with ye, that have wrestled for
               ye with the Lord!”</span> Here the loud tones of his voice sank into tenderness. <span class="quote">“And her too, poor woman! poor woman! her you are calling upon. She’s not here. You’ll
               find her with the Lord. Go there and seek her, not here. Do you hear me, lad? go after
               her there. He’ll let you in, though it’s late. Man, take heart! if you will lie and
               sob and greet, let it be at heaven’s gate, and not your poor mother’s ruined door.”</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            <span class="quote">“Lord,”</span> the minister said,—<span class="quote">“Lord, take him into Thy everlasting habitations. The mother he cries to is with Thee.
               Who can open to him but Thee? Lord, when is it too late for Thee, or what is too hard
               for Thee? Lord, let that woman there draw him inower! Let her draw him inower!”</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            It seemed to me that it must be the middle of the night, as we all walked back. It
            was in reality very late. <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span> put his arm into mine. He walked slowly, with an air of exhaustion. It was as if
            we were coming from a death-bed. Something hushed and solemnized the very air. There
            was that sense of relief in it which there always is at the end of a death-struggle.
            And nature, persistent, never daunted, came back in all of us, as we returned into
            the ways of life. We said nothing to each other, indeed, for a time; but when we got
            clear of the trees and reached the opening near the house, where we could see the
            sky, <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span> himself was the first to speak. <span class="quote">“I must be going,”</span> he said; <span class="quote">“it’s very late, I’m afraid. I will go down the glen, as I came.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“But not alone. I am going with you, Doctor.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Well, I will not oppose it. I am an old man, and agitation wearies more than work.
               Yes; I’ll be thankful of your arm. To-night, Colonel, you’ve done me more good turns
               than one.”</span>
            
            I pressed his hand on my arm, not feeling able to speak. But Simson, who turned with
            us, and who had gone along all this time with his taper flaring, in entire unconsciousness,
            came to himself, apparently at the sound of our voices, and put out that wild little
            torch with a quick movement, as if of shame. <span class="quote">“Let me carry your lantern,”</span> he said; <span class="quote">“it is heavy.”</span> He recovered with a spring; and in a moment, from the awe-stricken spectator he had
            been, became himself, sceptical and cynical. <span class="quote">“I should like to ask you a question,”</span> he said. <span class="quote">“Do you believe in Purgatory, Doctor? It’s not in the tenets of the Church, so far
               as I know.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Sir,”</span> said <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span>, <span class="quote">“an old man like me is sometimes not very sure what he believes. There is just one
               thing I am certain of—and that is the loving-kindness of God.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“But I thought that was in this life. I am no theologian—”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Sir,”</span> said the old man again, with a tremor in him which I could feel going over all his
            frame, <span class="quote">“if I saw a friend of mine within the gates of hell, I would not despair but his Father
               would take him by the hand still, if he cried like you.”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“I allow it is very strange, very strange. I cannot see through it. That there must
               be human agency, I feel sure. Doctor, what made you decide upon the person and the
               name?”</span>
            
            The minister put out his hand with the impatience which a man might show if he were
            asked how he recognized his brother. <span class="quote">“Tuts!”</span> he said, in familiar speech; then more solemnly, <span class="quote">“How should I not recognize a person that I know better—far better—than I know you?”</span>
            
            <span class="quote">“Then you saw the man?”</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            <span class="quote">“Far from that—better. God bless him!”</span> <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span> said.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            For some nights after, I watched among the ruins, spending all the dark hours up to
            midnight patrolling about the bit of wall which was associated with so many emotions;
            but I heard nothing, and saw nothing beyond the quiet course of nature; nor, so far
            as I am aware, has anything been heard again. <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span> gave me the history of the youth, whom he never hesitated to name. I did not ask,
            as Simson did, how he recognized him. He had been a prodigal,—weak, foolish, easily
            imposed upon, and <span class="quote">“led away,”</span> as people say. All that we had heard had passed actually in life, the Doctor said.
            The young man had come home thus a day or two after his mother died,—who was no more
            than the housekeeper in the old house,—and distracted with the news, had thrown himself
            down at the door and called upon her to let him in. The old man could scarcely speak
            of it for tears. To me it seemed as if—Heaven help us, how little do we know about
            anything!—a scene like that might impress itself somehow upon the hidden heart of
            nature. I do not pretend to know how, but the repetition had struck me at the time
            as, in its terrible strangeness and incomprehensibility, almost mechanical,—as if
            the unseen actor could not exceed or vary, but was bound to re-enact the whole. One
            thing that struck me, however, greatly, was the likeness between the old minister
            and my boy in the manner of regarding these strange phenomena. <span class="character">Dr. Moncrieff</span> was not terrified, as I had been myself, and all the rest of us. It was no <span class="quote">“ghost,”</span> as I fear we all vulgarly considered it, to him,—but a poor creature whom he knew
            under these conditions, just as he had known him in the flesh, having no doubt of
            his identity. And to <span class="character">Roland</span> it was the same. This spirit in pain,—if it was a spirit,—this voice out of the unseen,—was
            a poor fellow-creature in misery, to be succored and helped out of his trouble, to
            my boy. He spoke to me quite frankly about it when he got better. <span class="quote">“I knew father would find out some way,”</span> he said. And this was when he was strong and well, and all idea that he would turn
            hysterical or become a seer of visions had happily passed away.
            </p>
         <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Tone: n/a]</span><br>
            Bagley left my service as soon as he got well. He assured me it was no want of respect,
            but he could not stand <span class="quote">“them kind of things;”</span> and the man was so shaken and ghastly that I was glad to give him a present and let
            him go. For my own part, I made a point of staying out the time—two years—for which
            I had taken <span class="place">Brentwood</span>; but I did not renew my tenancy. By that time we had settled, and found for ourselves
            a pleasant home of our own.</p>
