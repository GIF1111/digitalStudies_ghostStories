    <title>LOIS THE WITCH </title>
    <chapter n="1">Chapter 1 <p tone="serious"> In the year <year>1691</year>, <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois Barclay</character> stood on a little wooden pier, steadying
            herself on the stable land, in much the same manner as, eight or nine weeks ago, she had
            tried to steady herself on the deck of the rocking ship which had carried her across
            from <place>Old</place> to <place>New England</place>. It seemed as strange now to be on
            solid earth as it had been, not long ago, to be rocked by the sea, both by day and by
            night; and the aspect of the land was equally strange. The forests which showed in the
            distance all round, and which, in truth, were not very far from the wooden houses
            forming the town of <place>Boston</place>, were of different shades of green, and
            different, too, in shape of outline to those which <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois
                Barclay</character> knew well in her old home in <place>Warwickshire</place>. Her
            heart sank a little as she stood alone, waiting for the <character ref="captain"
                >captain</character> of the good ship Redemption, the kind rough old sailor, who was
            her only known friend in this unknown continent. <character ref="captain">Captain
                Holdernesse</character> was busy, however, as she saw, and it would probably be some
            time before he would be ready to attend to her; so <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> sat down on one of the casks that lay about, and wrapped her grey
            duffle cloak tight around her, and sheltered herself under her hood, as well as might
            be, from the piercing wind, which seemed to follow those whom it had tyrannized over at
            sea with a dogged wish of still tormenting them on land. Very patiently did <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> sit there, although she was weary, and shivering
            with cold; for the day was severe for May, and the Redemption, with store of necessaries
            and comforts for the <character ref="colonists">Puritan colonists</character> of
                <place>New England</place>, was the earliest ship that had ventured across the seas. </p>
        <p tone="sadness"> How could <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> help thinking of the past, and
            speculating on the future, as she sat on <place>Boston pier</place>, at this
            breathing-time of her life? In the dim sea-mist which she gazed upon with aching eyes
            (filled, against her will, with tears, from time to time), there rose the little village
                <place>church of Barford</place> (not three miles from <place>Warwick</place>—you
            may see it yet), where her father had preached ever since <year>1661</year>, long before
            she was born. He and her mother both lay dead in <place>Barford churchyard</place>; and
            the old low grey church could hardly come before her vision without her seeing the old
            parsonage too, the cottage covered with Austrian roses, and yellow jessamine, where she
            had been born, sole child of parents already long past the prime of youth. She saw the
            path, not a hundred yards long, from the parsonage to the vestry door: that path which
            her father trod daily; for the vestry was his study, and the sanctum, where he pored
            over the ponderous tomes of the Fathers, and compared their precepts with those of the
            authorities of the Anglican Church of that day—the day of the later Stuarts; for
                <place>Barford Parsonage</place> at that time scarcely exceeded in size and dignity
            the cottages by which it was surrounded: it only contained three rooms on a floor, and
            was but two stories high. On the first, or ground floor, were the parlour, kitchen, and
            back or working kitchen; up-stairs, Mr. and Mrs. Barclay's room, that belonging to
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, and the maid-servant's room. If a
            guest came, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> left her own chamber, and
            shared old <character ref="Clemence">Clemence's</character>bed. But those days were over. Never more
            should <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> see father or mother on earth;
            they slept, calm and still, in <place>Barford churchyard</place>, careless of what
            became of their orphan child, as far as earthly manifestations of care or love went. And
            <character ref="Clemence">Clemence</character> lay there too, bound down in her grassy bed by
            withes of the briar-rose, which <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> had
            trained over those three precious graves before leaving <place>England</place> for ever. </p>
        <p tone="cynical"> There were some who would fain have kept her there; one who swore in his heart a great
            oath unto the Lord that he would seek her sooner or later, if she was still upon the
            earth. But he was the rich heir and only son of the <character ref="Miller Lucy">Miller Lucy</character>,
            whose mill stood by the <place>Avon-side</place> in the grassy <place>Barford
                meadows</place>, and his father looked higher for him than the penniless daughter of
                <character ref="Parson Barclay">Parson Barclay</character> (so low were clergymen
            esteemed in those days!); and the very suspicion of <character ref="Hugh Lucy">Hugh
                Lucy</character>'s attachment to <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois
                Barclay</character> made his parents think it more prudent not to offer the orphan a
            home, although none other of the parishioners had the means, even if they had the will,
            to do so.</p>
        <p tone="serious"> So <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> swallowed her tears down till the time
            came for crying, and acted upon her mother's words: </p>
        <p tone="sadness">
            <quote>'<character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, thy father is dead of this
                terrible fever, and I am dying. Nay, it is so, though I am easier from pain for
                these few hours, the Lord be praised! The cruel men of the Commonwealth have left
                thee very friendless. Thy father's only brother was shot down at
                    <place>Edgehill</place>. I, too, have a brother, though thou hast never heard me
                speak of him, for he was a schismatic; and thy father and he had words, and he left
                for that new country beyond the seas, without ever saying farewell to us. But
                <character ref="Ralph Hickson">Ralph</character> was a kind lad until he took up these new-fangled
                notions, and for the old days’ sake he will take thee in, and love thee as a child,
                and place thee among his children. Blood is thicker than water. Write to him as soon
                as I am gone—for <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, I am going—and I
                bless the Lord that has letten me join my husband again so soon.' Such was the
                selfishness of conjugal love; she thought little of <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                    >Lois</character>’s desolation in comparison with her rejoicing over her speedy
                reunion with her dead husband! 'Write to thine uncle, <character ref="Ralph Hickson">Ralph
                    Hickson</character>, <place>Salem</place>, <place>New England</place> (put it
                down, child, on thy tablets), and say that I, <character ref="Henrietta
                    Barclay">Henrietta
                    Barclay</character>, charge him, for the sake of all he holds dear in heaven or
                on earth,—for his salvation's sake, as well as for the sake of the old home at
                    <place>Lester-bridge</place>,—for the sake of the father and mother that gave us
                birth, as well as for the sake of the six little children who lie dead between him
                and me,—that he take thee into his home as if thou wert his own flesh and blood, as
                indeed thou art. He has a wife and children of his own, and no one need fear having
                thee, my <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, my darling, my baby, among
                his household. Oh, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, would that thou
                wert dying with me! The thought of thee makes death sore!'</quote>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> comforted her mother more than herself,
            poor child, by promises to obey her dying wishes to the letter, and by expressing hopes
            she dared not feel of her uncle’s kindness. </p>
        <p tone="serious">
            <quote>'Promise me'</quote>—the dying woman's breath came harder and harder—<quote>'that
                thou wilt go at once. The money our goods will bring—the letter thy father wrote to
                    <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse</character>, his old
                schoolfellow—thou knowest all I would say—my <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                    >Lois</character>, God bless thee!'</quote>
        </p>
        <p tone="serious"> Solemnly did <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> promise; strictly she kept
            her word. It was all the more easy, for <character ref="Hugh Lucy">Hugh Lucy</character>
            met her, and told her, in one great burst of love, of his passionate attachment, his
            vehement struggles with his father, his impotence at present, his hope and resolves for
            the future. And, intermingled with all this, came such outrageous threats and
            expressions of uncontrolled vehemence, that <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> felt that in <place>Barford</place> she must not linger to be a
            cause of desperate quarrel between father and son, while her absence might soften down
            matters, so that either the rich old <character ref="Miller Lucy">Miller
                Lucy</character> might relent, or—and her heart ached to think of the other
                possibility—<character ref="Hugh Lucy">Hugh</character>'s love might cool, and the
            dear play-fellow of her childhood learn to forget. If not—if <character ref="Hugh Lucy"
                >Hugh</character> were to be trusted in one tithe of what he said—God might permit
            him to fulfil his resolve of coming to seek her out before many years were over. It was
            all in God's hands, and that was best, thought <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois
                Barclay</character>. </p>
        <p tone="serious"> She was roused out of her trance of recollections by <character
                ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse</character>, who, having done all that
            was necessary in the way of orders and directions to his mate, now came up to her, and,
            praising her for her quiet patience, told her that he would now take her to the
                <character ref="Widow Smith">Widow Smith's</character>, a decent kind of house,
            where he and many other sailors of the better order were in the habit of lodging, during
            their stay on the <place>New England</place> shores. <character ref="Widow Smith">Widow
                Smith</character>, he said, had a parlour for herself and her daughters, in which
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> might sit, while he went about the
            business that, as he had told her, would detain him in <place>Boston</place> for a day
            or two, before he could accompany her to her uncle's at <place>Salem</place>. All this
            had been to a certain degree arranged on ship-board; but <character
                ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse</character>, for want of anything else
            that he could think of to talk about, recapitulated it as he and <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> walked along. It was his way of showing sympathy
            with the emotion that made her grey eyes full of tears, as she started up from the pier
            at the sound of his voice. In his heart he said, <quote>'Poor wench! poor wench! it's a
                strange land to her, and they are all strange folks, and, I reckon, she will be
                feeling desolate. I'll try and cheer her up.'</quote> So he talked on about hard
            facts, connected with the life that lay before her, until they reached <character
                ref="Widow Smith">Widow Smith</character>'s; and perhaps <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was more brightened by this style of
            conversation, and the new ideas it presented to her, than she would have been by the
            tenderest woman's sympathy. </p>
        <p tone="ironic">
            <quote>'They are a queer set, these <place>New Englanders</place>,'</quote> said
                <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse</character>. 'They are rare
            chaps for praying; down on their knees at every turn of their life. Folk are none so
            busy in a new country, else they would have to pray like me, with a "Yo-hoy!" on each
            side of my prayers, and a rope cutting like fire through my hand. Yon pilot was for
            calling us all to thanksgiving for a good voyage, and lucky escape from the pirates; but
            I said I always put up my thanks on dry land, after I had got my ship into harbour. The
            French colonists, too, are vowing vengeance for the expedition against
                <place>Canada</place>, and the people here are raging like heathens—at least, as
            like as godly folk can be—for the loss of their charter. All that is the news the pilot
            told me; for, for all he wanted us to be thanksgiving instead of casting the lead, he
            was as down in the mouth as could be about the state of the country. But here we are at
                <character ref="Widow Smith">Widow Smith</character>'s! Now, cheer up, and show the
            godly a pretty smiling <place>Warwickshire</place> lass!' </p>
        <p tone="happiness"> Anybody would have smiled at <character ref="Widow Smith">Widow Smith</character>'s
            greeting. She was a comely, motherly woman, dressed in the primmest fashion in vogue
            twenty years before, in <place>England</place>, among the class to which she belonged.
            But, somehow, her pleasant face gave the lie to her dress; were it as brown and
            sober-coloured as could be, folk remembered it bright and cheerful, because it was a
            part of <character ref="Widow Smith">Widow Smith</character> herself. </p>
        <p tone="happiness"> She kissed <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> on both cheeks, before she
            rightly understood who the stranger maiden was, only because she was a stranger, and
            looked sad and forlorn; and then she kissed her again, because <character
                ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse</character> commended her to the
            widow's good offices. And so she led <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> by
            the hand into her rough, substantial log-house, over the door of which hung a great
            bough of a tree, by way of sign of entertainment for man and horse. Yet not all men were
            received by <character ref="Widow Smith">Widow Smith</character>. To some she could be
            as cold and reserved as need be, deaf to all inquiries save one—where else they could
            find accommodation? To this question she would give a ready answer, and speed the
            unwelcome guest on his way. <character ref="Widow Smith">Widow Smith</character> was
            guided in these matters by instinct: one glance at a man's face told her whether or not
            she chose to have him as an inmate of the same house as her daughters; and her
            promptness of decision in these matters gave her manner a kind of authority which no one
            liked to disobey, especially as she had stalwart neighbours within call to back her, if
            her assumed deafness in the first instance, and her voice and gesture in the second,
            were not enough to give the would-be guest his dismissal. <character ref="Widow Smith"
                >Widow Smith</character> chose her customers merely by their physical aspect; not
            one whit with regard to their apparent worldly circumstances. Those who had been staying
            at her house once, always came again, for she had the knack of making every one beneath
            her roof comfortable and at his ease. Her daughters, <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> and
            <character ref="Hester">Hester</character>, had somewhat of their mother's gifts, but not in such
            perfection. They reasoned a little upon a stranger's appearance, instead of knowing at
            the first moment whether they liked him or no; they noticed the indications of his
            clothes, the quality and cut thereof, as telling somewhat of his station in society;
            they were more reserved, they hesitated more than their mother; they had not her prompt
            authority, her happy power. Their bread was not so light, their cream went sometimes to
            sleep when it should have been turning into butter, their hams were not always
                <quote>'just like the hams of the old country,'</quote> as their mother's were
            invariably pronounced to be; yet they were good, orderly, kindly girls, and rose and
            greeted <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> with a friendly shake of the
            hand, as their mother, with her arm round the stranger's waist, led her into the private
            room which she called her parlour. The aspect of this room was strange in the
                <place>English</place> girl's eyes. The logs of which the house was built, showed
            here and there through the mud plaster, although before both plaster and logs were hung
            the skins of many curious animals,—skins presented to the widow by many a trader of her
            acquaintance, just as her sailor guests brought her another description of gift—shells,
            strings of wampum-beads, sea-birds' eggs, and presents from the <place>Old
                Country</place>. The room was more like a small museum of natural history of these
            days than a parlour; and it had a strange, peculiar, but not unpleasant smell about it,
            neutralized in some degree by the smoke from the enormous trunk of pinewood which
            smouldered on the hearth. </p>
        <p tone="ironic"> The instant their mother told them that <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain
                Holdernesse</character> was in the outer room, the girls began putting away their
            spinning-wheel and knitting-needles, and preparing for a meal of some kind; what meal,
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, sitting there and unconsciously
            watching, could hardly tell. First, dough was set to rise for cakes; then came out of a
            corner cupboard—a present from <place>England</place>—an enormous square bottle of a
            cordial called Golden Wasser; next, a mill for grinding chocolate—a rare unusual treat
            anywhere at that time; then a great Cheshire cheese. Three venison steaks were cut ready
            for broiling, fat cold pork sliced up and treacle poured over it, a great pie something
            like a mince-pie, but which the daughters spoke of with honour as the
                <quote>'punken-pie,'</quote> fresh and salt fish brandered, oysters cooked in
            various ways. <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> wondered where would be the
            end of the provisions for hospitably receiving the strangers from the <place>Old
                Country</place>. At length everything was placed on the table, the hot food smoking;
            but all was cool, not to say cold, before <character ref=">Elder Hawkins">Elder Hawkins</character> (an old
            neighbour of much repute and standing, who had been invited in by <character
                ref="Widow Smith">Widow Smith</character> to hear the news) had finished his grace,
            into which was embodied thanksgivings for the past and prayers for the future lives of
            every individual present, adapted to their several cases, as far as the elder could
            guess at them from appearances. This grace might not have ended so soon as it did, had
            it not been for the somewhat impatient drumming of his knife-handle on the table with
            which <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse</character> accompanied
            the latter half of the elder's words. </p>
        <p tone="serious"> When they first sat down to their meal, all were too hungry for much talking; but as
            their appetites diminished their curiosity increased, and there was much to be told and
            heard on both sides. With all the English intelligence <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> was, of course, well acquainted; but she listened with natural
            attention to all that was said about the new country, and the new people among whom she
            had come to live. Her father had been a Jacobite, as the
            adherents of the <character ref="Stuarts">Stuarts</character> were beginning at this
            time to be called. His father, again, had been a follower of <character
                ref="Archbishop Laud">Archbishop Laud</character>; so <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> had hitherto heard little of the conversation, and seen little of
            the ways of the Puritans. <character ref="Elder Hawkins">Elder Hawkins</character> was
            one of the strictest of the strict, and evidently his presence kept the two daughters of
            the house considerably in awe. But the widow herself was a privileged person; her known
            goodness of heart (the effects of which had been experienced by many) gave her the
            liberty of speech which was tacitly denied to many, under penalty of being esteemed
            ungodly if they infringed certain conventional limits. And <character

                <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse,</character> beside the
            driver. There was a basket of provisions under their feet, and behind them hung a bag of
            provender for the horse; for it was a good day's journey to <place>Salem</place>, and
            the road was reputed so dangerous that it was ill tarrying a minute longer than
            necessary for refreshment. English roads were bad enough at that period and for long
            after, but in America the way was simply the cleared ground of the forest; the stumps of
            the felled trees still remaining in the direct line, forming obstacles, which it
            required the most careful driving to avoid; and in the hollows, where the ground was
            swampy, the pulpy nature of it was obviated by logs of wood laid across the boggy part.
            The deep green forest, tangled into heavy darkness even thus early in the year, came
            within a few yards of the road all the way, though efforts were regularly made by the
            inhabitants of the neighbouring settlements to keep a certain space clear on each side,
            for fear of the lurking Indians, who might otherwise come upon them unawares. The cries
            of strange birds, the unwonted colour of some of them, all suggested to the imaginative
            or unaccustomed traveller the idea of war-whoops and painted deadly enemies. But at last
            they drew near to <place>Salem</place>, which rivalled <place>Boston</place> in size in

            looked rather more like irregularly built houses, clustered round the meeting-house, or
            rather one of the meeting-houses, for a second was in process of building. The whole
            place was surrounded with two circles of stockades; between the two were the gardens and
            grazing ground for those who dreaded their cattle straying into the woods, and the
            consequent danger of reclaiming them.</p>

            coming into his stern, dark face. There was no woman in the house-place. <character

            said:</p>

            looked at her steadily and gravely for a minute; then rose, and carefully marking the
            page in the folio which hitherto had lain open upon his knee, said, still in the same
            heavy, indifferent manner,<quote> 'I will call my mother, she will know.'</quote></p>
        <p tone="serious"> He opened a door which looked into a warm bright kitchen, ruddy with the light of the
            fire over which three women were apparently engaged in cooking something, while a
            fourth, an old Indian woman, of a greenish-brown colour, shrivelled up and bent with
            apparent age, moved backwards and forwards, evidently fetching the others the articles

            his book, from time to time, however, furtively examining <character ref="Lois Barclay"

            newly-arrived strangers. She was like her brother Manasseh in complexion, but had
            handsomer features, and large, mysterious-looking eyes, as <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> saw, when once she lifted them up, and took in, as it were, the
            aspect of the <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">sea-captain</character> and her
            cousin with one swift searching look. About the stiff, tall, angular mother, and the
            scarce less pliant figure of the daughter, a girl of twelve years old, or thereabouts,
            played all manner of impish antics, unheeded by them, as if it were her accustomed habit

            weary, and somewhat disheartened by their reception. The <character

            it by way of consolation; but in a moment or two, his usual elasticity of spirit came to
            his rescue, and he said in a low voice to <character ref="Lois Barclay"

            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> brushed away her tears, and looking round

            made <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> uncomfortable, particularly as he

            father nor mother left upon earth; and that she had been bidden by her mother's last
            words to seek him out, and ask him for a home. Her words came up, half choked from a
            heavy heart, and his dulled wits could not take their meaning in without several
            repetitions; and then he cried like a child, rather at his own loss of a sister, whom he
            had not seen for more than twenty years, than at that of the orphan's standing before
            him, trying hard not to cry, but to start bravely in this new strange home. What most of
            all helped <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> in her self-restraint was her
            aunt's unsympathetic look. Born and bred in New England, Grace Hickson had a kind of

            years his weakened mind yearned after them, and he forgot the good reason he had had for
            his self-exile, and moaned over the decision which had led to it as the great mistake of

            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> felt ashamed and sorry to find that her
            aunt had so truly interpreted the momentary expression of her features; she blamed
            herself a little for the feeling that had caused that expression, trying to think how
            much her aunt might have been troubled with something before the unexpected irruption of
            the strangers, and again hoping that the remembrance of this little misunderstanding
            would soon pass away. So she endeavoured to reassure herself, and not to give way to her
            uncle's tender trembling pressure of her hand, as, at her aunt's bidding, she wished him
            good night, and returned into the outer, or <quote>'keeping'</quote>-room, where all the
            family were now assembled, ready for the meal of flour cakes and venison-steaks which
            <character>Nattee</character>, the Indian servant, was bringing in from the kitchen. No one seemed to have been

                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> had been away. <character>Manasseh</character> sat quiet and
            silent where he did, with the book open upon his knee, his eyes thoughtfully fixed on
            vacancy, as if he saw a vision, or dreamed dreams. <character>Faith</character> stood by the table, lazily
            directing <character>Nattee</character> in her preparations; and <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> lolled against the door-frame,
            between kitchen and keeping-room, playing tricks on the old Indian woman as she passed
            backwards and forwards, till Nattee appeared to be in a strong state of expressed
            irritation, which he tried in vain to repress, as whenever she showed any sign of it,
            <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> only seemed excited to greater mischief. When all was ready, <character>Manasseh</character> lifted
            his right hand, and <quote>'asked a blessing,'</quote> as it was termed; but the grace
            became a long prayer for abstract spiritual blessings, for strength to combat Satan, and
            to quench his fiery darts, and at length assumed, so <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> thought, a purely personal character, as if the young man had
            forgotten the occasion, and even the people present, but was searching into the nature
            of the diseases that beset his own sick soul, and spreading them out before the Lord. He
            was brought back by a pluck at the coat from <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>; he opened his shut eyes, cast an
            angry glance at the child, who made a face at him for sole reply, and then he sat down,
            and they all fell to. <character>Grace Hickson</character> would have thought her hospitality sadly at fault,
            if she had allowed <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse
            </character>to go out in search of a bed. Skins were spread for him on the floor of the
            keeping-room; a Bible, and a square bottle of spirits were placed on the table, to
            supply his wants during the night; and in spite of all the cares and troubles,
            temptations, or sins of the members of that household, they were all asleep before the

    <chapter n="2">Chapter 2 <p tone="sadness"> It was hard up-hill work for <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> to win herself a place in this family. Her aunt was a woman of
            narrow, strong affections. Her love for her husband, if ever she had any, was burnt out
            and dead long ago. What she did for him she did from duty; but duty was not strong
            enough to restrain that little member the tongue; and <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>'s heart often bled at the continual flow of contemptuous reproof
            which <character>Grace</character> constantly addressed to her husband, even while she was sparing no pains or
            trouble to minister to his bodily ease and comfort. It was more as a relief to herself
            that she spoke in this way, than with any desire that her speeches should affect him;
            and he was too deadened by illness to feel hurt by them; or, it may be, the constant
            repetition of her sarcasms had made him indifferent; at any rate, so that he had his
            food and his state of bodily warmth attended to, he very seldom seemed to care much for
            anything else. Even his first flow of affection towards <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> was soon exhausted; he cared for her because she arranged his
            pillows well and skilfully, and because she could prepare new and dainty kinds of food
            for his sick appetite, but no longer for her as his dead sister's child. Still he did
            care for her, and <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was too glad of this
            little hoard of affection to examine how or why it was given. To him she could give
            pleasure, but apparently to no one else in that household. Her aunt looked askance at
            her for many reasons: the first coming of <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>
            to Salem was inopportune, the expression of disapprobation on her face on that evening
            still lingered and rankled in <character>Grace's</character> memory, early prejudices, and feelings, and
            prepossessions of the English girl were all on the side of what would now be called
            Church and State, what was then esteemed in that country a superstitious observance of
            the directions of a Popish rubric, and a servile regard for the family of an oppressing
            and irreligious king. Nor is it to be supposed that <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> did not feel, and feel acutely, the want of sympathy that all
            those with whom she was now living manifested towards the old hereditary loyalty
            (religious as well as political loyalty) in which she had been brought up. With her aunt
            and <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> it was more than want of sympathy; it
            was positive, active antipathy to all the ideas <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> held most dear. The very allusion, however incidentally made, to
            the little old grey church at <place>Barford</place>, where her father had preached so long,—the
            occasional reference to the troubles in which her own country had been distracted when
            she left,—and the adherence, in which she had been brought up, to the notion that the
            king could do no wrong, seemed to irritate <character ref="Manasseh"
                >Manasseh</character> past endurance. He would get up from his reading, his constant
            employment when at home, and walk angrily about the room after <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> had said anything of this kind, muttering to
            himself; and once he had even stopped before her, and in a passionate tone bade her not
            talk so like a fool. Now this was very different to his mother's sarcastic,
                contemptuous way of treating all poor <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois's</character> little loyal speeches. <character>Grace</character> would lead her on—at least
            she did at first, till experience made <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>
            wiser—to express her thoughts on such subjects, till, just when the girl's heart was
            opening, her aunt would turn round upon her with some bitter sneer that roused all the
            evil feelings in <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois's</character> disposition by its
            sting. Now <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> seemed, through all his anger,
            to be so really grieved by what he considered her error, that he went much nearer to
            convincing her that there might be two sides to a question. Only this was a view, that
            it appeared like treachery to her dead father's memory to entertain.</p>
        <p tone="serious"> Somehow, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> felt instinctively that
                <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> was really friendly towards her. He
            was little in the house; there was farming, and some kind of mercantile business to be
            transacted by him, as real head of the house; and as the season drew on, he went
            shooting and hunting in the surrounding forests, with a daring which caused his mother
            to warn and reprove him in private, although to the neighbours she boasted largely of
            her son's courage and disregard of danger. <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> did not often walk out for the mere sake of walking, there was
            generally some household errand to be transacted when any of the women of the family
            went abroad; but once or twice she had caught glimpses of the dreary, dark wood, hemming
            in the cleared land on all sides,—the great wood with its perpetual movement of branch
            and bough, and its solemn wail, that came into the very streets of <place>Salem</place> when certain
            winds blew, bearing the sound of the pine-trees clear upon the ears that had leisure to
            listen. And from all accounts, this old forest, girdling round the settlement, was full
            of dreaded and mysterious beasts, and still more to be dreaded Indians, stealing in and
            out among the shadows, intent on bloody schemes against the Christian people;
            panther-streaked, shaven Indians, in league by their own confession, as well as by the
            popular belief, with evil powers.</p>
        <p tone="fear">
            <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character>, the old Indian servant, would occasionally
            make <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>'s blood run cold as she and
                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> and <character ref="Prudence"
                >Prudence</character> listened to the wild stories she told them of the wizards of
            her race. It was often in the kitchen, in the darkening evening, while some cooking
            process was going on, that the old Indian crone, sitting on her haunches by the bright
            red wood embers which sent up no flame, but a lurid light reversing the shadows of all
            the faces around, told her weird stories while they were awaiting the rising of the
            dough, perchance, out of which the household bread had to be made. There ran through
            these stories always a ghastly, unexpressed suggestion of some human sacrifice being
            needed to complete the success of any incantation to the Evil One; and the poor old
            creature, herself believing and shuddering as she narrated her tale in broken English,
            took a strange, unconscious pleasure in her power over her hearers—young girls of the
            oppressing race, which had brought her down into a state little differing from slavery,
            and reduced her people to outcasts on the hunting-grounds which had belonged to her
            fathers. After such tales, it required no small effort on <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>'s part to go out, at her aunt's command, into the common pasture
            round the town, and bring the cattle home at night. Who knew but what the double-headed
            snake might start up from each blackberry-bush—that wicked, cunning, accursed creature
            in the service of the Indian wizards, that had such power over all those white maidens
            who met the eyes placed at either end of his long, sinuous, creeping body, so that
            loathe him, loathe the Indian race as they would, off they must go into the forest to
            seek but some Indian man, and must beg to be taken into his wigwam, abjuring faith and
            race for ever? Or there were spells—so <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character>
            said—hidden about the ground by the wizards, which changed that person's nature who
            found them; so that, gentle and loving as they might have been before, thereafter they
            took no pleasure but in the cruel torments of others, and had a strange power given to
            them of causing such torments at their will. Once <character ref="Nattee"
                >Nattee</character>, speaking low to <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,
            who was alone with her in the kitchen, whispered out her terrified belief that such a
            spell had <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> found; and when the Indian
            showed her arms to <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, all pinched and black
            and blue by the impish child, the English girl began to be afraid of her cousin as of
            one possessed. But it was not <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> alone, nor
            young imaginative girls alone, that believed in these stories. We can afford to smile at
            them now; but our English ancestors entertained superstitions of much the same character
            at the same period, and with less excuse, as the circumstances surrounding them were
            better known, and consequently more explicable by common sense than the real mysteries
            of the deep, untrodden forests of New England. The gravest divines not only believed
            stories similar to that of the double-headed serpent, and other tales of witchcraft, but
            they made such narrations the subjects of preaching and prayer; and as cowardice makes
            us all cruel, men who were blameless in many of the relations of life, and even
            praiseworthy in some, became, from superstition, cruel persecutors about this time,
            showing no mercy towards any one whom they believed to be in league with the Evil
            One.</p>
        <p tone="serious">
            <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> was the person with whom the English girl was
            the most intimately associated in her uncle's house. The two were about the same age,
            and certain household employments were shared between them. They took it in turns to
            call in the cows, to make up the butter which had been churned by Hosea, a stiff old
            out-door servant, in whom Grace Hickson placed great confidence; and each lassie had her
            great spinning-wheel for wool, and her lesser for flax, before a month had elapsed after
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois's</character> coming. <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character> was a grave, silent person, never merry, sometimes very sad,
            though <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was a long time in even guessing
            why. She would try in her sweet, simple fashion to cheer her cousin up, when the latter
            was depressed, by telling her old stories of English ways and life. Occasionally,
                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> seemed to care to listen, occasionally she
            did not heed one word, but dreamed on. Whether of the past or of the future, who could
            tell?</p>
        <p tone="cynical"> Stern old ministers came in to pay their pastoral visits. On such occasions, <character>Grace
            Hickson </character>would put on clean apron and clean cap, and make them more welcome than she was
            ever seen to do no one else, bringing out the best provisions of her store, and setting
            of all before them. Also, the great Bible was brought forth, and <character>Hosea</character> and <character
                ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> summoned from their work to listen while the
            minister read a chapter, and, as he read, expounded it at considerable length. After
            this all knelt, while he, standing, lifted up his right hand, and prayed for all
            possible combinations of Christian men, for all possible cases of spiritual need; and
            lastly, taking the individuals before him, he would put up a very personal supplication
            for each, according to his notion of their wants. At first <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> wondered at the aptitude of one or two prayers of this description
            to the outward circumstances of each case; but when she perceived that her aunt had
            usually a pretty long confidential conversation with the minister in the early part of
            his visit, she became aware that he received both his impressions and his knowledge
            through the medium of <quote>'that godly woman, <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace

        <p tone="serious"> The truth was that, a year or two before, there had been a great struggle in <place>Salem</place>

                >Pastor Tappau</character> had been the leader of the more violent, and, ultimately,
            the successful party. In consequence of this, the less popular minister,<character> Mr. Nolan,</character> had
            had to leave the place. And him <character ref="Faith Hickson">Faith Hickson</character> loved
            with all the strength of her passionate heart, although he never was aware of the
            attachment he had excited, and her own family were too regardless of manifestations of
            mere feeling to ever observe the signs of any emotion on her part. But the old Indian
            servant <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> saw and observed them all. She knew,
            as well as if she had been told the reason, why <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>
            had lost all care about father or mother, brother and sister, about household work and
            daily occupation, nay, about the observances of religion as well. <character

                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>'s dislike to <character ref="Pastor Tappau"
                >Pastor Tappau</character> aright; the Indian woman understood why the girl (whom
            alone of all the white people she loved) avoided the old minister,—would hide in the

        <p tone="serious"> For a long time, the cause of her cousin's dislike and avoidance of the minister was a

            a suspected love affair, than from any indifferent and heartless curiosity, that she
            could not help piecing together little speeches and actions, with <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith's</character> interest in the absent banished minister, for an explanatory

            <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> grew sadder and duller as the autumn drew on.
            She lost her appetite, her brown complexion became sallow and colourless, her dark eyes
            looked hollow and wild. The first of November was near at hand. <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, in her instinctive, well-intentioned efforts to
            bring some life and cheerfulness into the monotonous household, had been telling
                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> of many English customs, silly enough, no
            doubt, and which scarcely lighted up a flicker of interest in the American girl's mind.
            The cousins were lying awake in their bed in the great unplastered room, which was in
            part store-room, in part bedroom. <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was
            full of sympathy for <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> that night. For long she
            had listened to her cousin's heavy, irrepressible sighs, in silence. <character

            without speaking in the dark, quiet night hours, for a long, long time. She kept quite
            still, because she thought such vent for sorrow might relieve her cousin's weary heart.
            But when at length, instead of lying motionless, <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character> seemed to be growing restless even to convulsive motions of her
            limbs, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> began to speak, to talk about
            England, and the dear old ways at home, without exciting much attention on <character
                ref="Faith">Faith's</character> part, until at length she fell upon the subject of
            Hallow-e'en, and told about customs then and long afterwards practised in England, and
            that have scarcely yet died out in Scotland. As she told of tricks she had often played,
            of the apple eaten facing a mirror, of the dripping sheet, of the basins of water, of
            the nuts burning side by side, and many other such innocent ways of divination, by which
            laughing, trembling English maidens sought to see the form of their future husbands, if
            husbands they were to have, then <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> listened
            breathlessly, asking short, eager questions, as if some ray of hope had entered into her
            gloomy heart. <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> went on speaking, telling
            her of all the stories that would confirm the truth of the second sight vouchsafed to
            all seekers in the accustomed methods, half believing, half incredulous herself, but

        <p tone="serious"> The whole of the ensuing day, they sat or moved in darkened rooms, and spoke few words,
            and those below their breath. <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> kept at
            home, regretting his father, no doubt, but showing little emotion. <character
                ref="Faith">Faith</character> was the child that bewailed her loss most grievously;
            she had a warm heart, hidden away somewhere under her moody exterior, and her father had
            shown her far more passive kindness than ever her mother had done, for <character>Grace</character> made
            distinct favourites of <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>, her only son, and
                <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>, her youngest child. <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was about as unhappy as any of them, for she had
            felt strongly drawn towards her uncle as her kindest friend, and the sense of his loss
            renewed the old sorrow she had experienced at her own parents' death. But she had no
            time and no place to cry in. On her devolved many of the cares, which it would have
            seemed indecorous in the nearer relatives to interest themselves in enough to take an
            active part: the change required in their dress, the household preparations for the sad
            feast of the funeral—<character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> had to arrange all
            under her aunt's stern direction.</p>
        <p tone="sadness"> But a day or two afterwards—the last day before the funeral—she went into the yard to
            fetch in some fagots for the oven; it was a solemn, beautiful, starlit evening, and some
            sudden sense of desolation in the midst of the vast universe thus revealed touched
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois's</character> heart, and she sat down behind the
            woodstack, and cried very plentiful tears.</p>
        <p tone="suspenseful"> She was startled by <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>, who suddenly turned
            the corner of the stack, and stood before her.</p>
        <p tone="suspenseful">
            <quote>'<character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> crying!'</quote></p>
        <p tone="suspenseful">
            <quote>'Only a little,'</quote> she said, rising up, and gathering her bundle of fagots,
            for she dreaded being questioned by her grim, impassive cousin. To her surprise, he laid
            his hand on her arm, and said:</p>
        <p tone="suspenseful">
            <quote>'Stop one minute. Why art thou crying, cousin?'</quote></p>
        <p tone="sadness">
            <quote>'I don't know,' </quote>she said, just like a child questioned in like manner;
            and she was again on the point of weeping.</p>
        <p tone="serious"> '<quote>My father was very kind to thee, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>; I do
            not wonder that thou grievest after him. But the Lord who taketh away can restore
            tenfold. I will be as kind as my father—yea, kinder. This is not a time to talk of
            marriage and giving in marriage. But after we have buried our dead, I wish to speak to
            thee.</quote>'</p>
        <p tone="suspenseful">
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> did not cry now, but she shrank with
            affright. What did her cousin mean? She would far rather that he had been angry with her
            for unreasonable grieving, for folly.</p>
        <p tone="fear"> She avoided him carefully—as carefully as she could, without seeming to dread him—for
            the next few days. Sometimes she thought it must have been a bad dream; for if there had
            been no English lover in the case, no other man in the whole world, she could never have
            thought of <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> as her husband; indeed, till
            now, there had been nothing in his words or actions to suggest such an idea. Now it had
            been suggested, there was no telling how much she loathed him. He might be good, and
            pious—he doubtless was—but his dark fixed eyes, moving so slowly and heavily, his lank
            black hair, his grey coarse skin, all made her dislike him now—all his personal ugliness
            and ungainliness struck on her senses with a jar, since those few words spoken behind
            the haystack.</p>
        <p tone="serious"> She knew that sooner or later the time must come for further discussion of this subject;
            but, like a coward, she tried to put it off, by clinging to her aunt's apron-string, for
            she was sure that <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character> had far
            different views for her only son. As, indeed, she had, for she was an ambitious, as well
            as a religious woman; and by an early purchase of land in Salem village, the Hicksons
            had become wealthy people, without any great exertions of their own; partly, also, by
            the silent process of accumulation, for they had never cared to change their manner of
            living from the time when it had been suitable to a far smaller income than that which
            they at present enjoyed. So much for worldly circumstances. As for their worldly
            character, it stood as high. No one could say a word against any of their habits or
            actions. The righteousness and godliness were patent to every one's eyes. So <character
                ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character> thought herself entitled to pick and
            choose among the maidens, before she should meet with one fitted to be <character
                ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>'s wife. None in <place>Salem</place> came up to her imaginary
            standard. She had it in her mind even at this very time—so soon after her husband's
            death—to go to <place>Boston</place>, and take counsel with the leading ministers there, with worthy
           <character> Mr. Cotton Mather</character> at their head, and see if they could tell her of a well-favoured and
            godly young maiden in their congregations worthy of being the wife of her son. But,
            besides good looks and godliness, the wench must have good birth, and good wealth, or
                <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character> would have put her
            contemptuously on one side. When once this paragon was found, the ministers had
            approved, <character>Grace</character> anticipated no difficulty on her son's part. So <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was right in feeling that her aunt would dislike
            any speech of marriage between <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> and
            herself.</p>
        <p tone="suspenseful"> But the girl was brought to bay one day in this wise. <character ref="Manasseh"
                >Manasseh</character> had ridden forth on some business, which every one said would
            occupy him the whole day; but, meeting the man with whom he had to transact his affairs,
            he returned earlier than any one expected. He missed <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> from the keeping-room where his sisters were spinning, almost
            immediately. His mother sat by at her knitting—he could see <character ref="Nattee"
                >Nattee</character> in the kitchen through the open door. He was too reserved to ask
            where <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was, but he quietly sought till he
            found her—in the great loft, already piled with winter stores of fruit and vegetables.
            Her aunt had sent her there to examine the apples one by one, and pick out such as were
            unsound, for immediate use. She was stooping down, and intent upon this work, and was
            hardly aware of his approach, until she lifted up her head and saw him standing close
            before her. She dropped the apple she was holding, went a little paler than her wont,
            and faced him in silence.</p>
        <p tone="serious">
            <quote>'<character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,'</quote> he said, <quote>'thou
            rememberest the words that I spoke while we yet mourned over my father. I think that I
            am called to marriage now, as the head of this household. And I have seen no maiden so
            pleasant in my sight as thou art, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>!'</quote> He
            tried to take her hand. But she put it behind her with a childish shake of her head,
            and, half-crying, said:</p>
        <p tone="sadness"> <quote>'Please, Cousin <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>, do not say this to me. I
            dare say you ought to be married, being the head of the household now; but I don't want
            to be married. I would rather not.'</quote></p>
        <p tone="serious">
            <quote>'That is well spoken,'</quote> replied he, frowning a little, nevertheless. <quote>'I
            should not like to take to wife an over-forward maiden, ready to jump at wedlock.
            Besides, the congregation might talk, if we were to be married too soon after my
            father's death. We have, perchance, said enough, even now. But I wished thee to have thy
            mind set at ease as to thy future well-doing. Thou wilt have leisure to think of it, and
            to bring thy mind more fully round to it.' </quote>Again he held out his hand. This time she
            took hold of it with a free, frank gesture.</p>
        <p tone="serious"> <quote>'I owe you somewhat for your kindness to me ever since I came, Cousin <character
                ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>; and I have no way of paying you but by telling
            you truly I can love you as a dear friend, if you will let me, but never as a wife.'</quote></p>
        <p tone="serious"> He flung her hand away, but did not take his eyes off her face, though his glance was
            lowering and gloomy. He muttered something which she did not quite hear, and so she went
            on bravely although she kept trembling a little, and had much ado to keep from
            crying.</p>
        <p tone="serious"> <quote>'Please let me tell you all. There was a young man in Barford—nay, <character
                ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>, I cannot speak if you are so angry; it is hard
            work to tell you any how—he said that he wanted to marry me; but I was poor, and his
            father would have none of it, and I do not want to marry any one; but if I did, it would
            be—' </quote>Her voice dropped, and her blushes told the rest. <character ref="Manasseh"
                >Manasseh</character> stood looking at her with sullen, hollow eyes, that had a
            glittering touch of wilderness in them, and then he said:</p>
        <p tone="serious"> <quote>'It is borne in upon me—verily I see it as in a vision—that thou must be my spouse, and
            no other man's. Thou canst not escape what is foredoomed. Months ago, when I set myself
            to read the old godly books in which my soul used to delight until thy coming, I saw no
            letters of printers' ink marked on the page, but I saw a gold and ruddy type of some
            unknown language, the meaning whereof was whispered into my soul; it was, <quote>"Marry
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>! marry <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>!"</quote> And when my father died, I knew it was the beginning of the end.
            It is the Lord's will, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, and thou
                canst not escape from it.'</quote> And again he would have taken her hand and drawn
            her towards him. But this time she eluded him with ready movement.</p>
        <p tone="serious">
            <quote>'I do not acknowledge it be the Lord's will, <character ref="Manasseh"
                >Manasseh</character>,'</quote> said she. '<quote>It is not "borne in upon me," as
            you Puritans call it, that I am to be your wife. I am none so set upon wedlock as to
            take you, even though there be no other chance for me. For I do not care for you as I
            ought to care for my husband. But I could have cared for you very much as a cousin—as a
            kind cousin.'</quote></p>
        <p tone="sadness"> She stopped speaking; she could not choose the right words with which to speak to him of
            her gratitude and friendliness, which yet could never be any feeling nearer and dearer,
            no more than two parallel lines can ever meet.</p>
        <p tone="serious"> But he was so convinced, by what he considered the spirit of prophecy, that <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was to be his wife, that he felt rather more
            indignant at what he considered to be her resistance to the preordained decree, than
            really anxious as to the result. Again he tried to convince her that neither he nor she
            had any choice in the matter, by saying:</p>
        <p tone="serious">
            <quote>'The voice said unto me <quote>"Marry <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,"</quote>
                and I said, <quote>"I will, Lord."</quote>'</quote></p>
        <p tone="serious">
            <quote>'But,'</quote>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> replied,<quote> 'the voice, as you call it, has

        <p tone="serious">
            <quote>'<character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,'</quote> he answered, solemnly,
         <quote>   'it will speak. And then wilt thou obey, even as Samuel did?'</quote></p>
        <p tone="serious">
            <quote>'No, indeed I cannot!'</quote> she answered, briskly.<quote> 'I may take a dream to be
            truth, and hear my own fancies, if I think about them too long. But I cannot marry any

        <p tone="serious"><quote> '<character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, <character ref="Lois Barclay"

            but it shall not always be so. I will pray that thou mayest see thy preordained course.
            Meanwhile, I will smooth away all worldly obstacles.'</quote></p>

            <quote>'Cousin <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>! Cousin <character

            thee enough to marry thee, or to wed thee without such love. And this I say solemnly,
            because it is better that this should end at once.'</quote></p>
        <p tone="serious"> For a moment he was staggered; then he lifted up his hands, and said,</p>
        <p tone="serious"> <quote>'God forgive thee thy blasphemy! Remember Hazael, who said, <quote>"Is thy servant a dog, that
            he should do this great thing?"</quote> and went straight and did it, because his evil courses
            were fixed and appointed for him from before the foundation of the world. And shall not
            thy paths be laid out among the godly as it hath been foretold to me?</quote>'</p>
        <p tone="suspenseful"> He went away; and for a minute or two <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>
            felt as if his words must come true, and that, struggle as she would, hate her doom as
            she would, she must become his wife; and, under the circumstances, many a girl would
            have succumbed to her apparent fate. Isolated from all previous connections, hearing no
            word from England, living in the heavy, monotonous routine of a family with one man for
            head, and this man esteemed a hero by most of those around him, simply because he was
            the only man in the family,—these facts alone would have formed strong presumptions that
            most girls would have yielded to the offers of such a one. But, besides this, there was
            much to tell upon the imagination in those days, in that place, and time. It was
            prevalently believed that there were manifestations of spiritual influence—of the direct
            influence both of good and bad spirits—constantly to be perceived in the course of men's
            lives. Lots were drawn, as guidance from the Lord; the Bible was opened, and the leaves
            allowed to fall apart, and the first text the eye fell upon was supposed to be appointed
            from above a direction. Sounds were heard that could not be accounted for; they were
            made by the evil spirits not yet banished from the desert places of which they had so
            long held possession. Sights, inexplicable and mysterious, were dimly seen—Satan, in
            some shape, seeking whom he might devour. And at the beginning of the long winter
            season, such whispered tales, such old temptations and hauntings, and devilish terrors,
            were supposed to be peculiarly rife. Salem was, as it were, snowed up, and left to prey
            upon itself. The long, dark evenings, the dimly-lighted rooms, the creaking passages,
            where heterogeneous articles were piled away out of reach of the keen-piercing frost,
            and where occasionally, in the dead of night, a sound was heard, as of some heavy
            falling body, when, next morning, everything appeared to be in its right place—so
            accustomed are we to measure noises by comparison with themselves, and not with the
            absolute stillness of the night-season—the white mist, coming nearer and nearer to the
            windows every evening in strange shapes, like phantoms,—all these, and many other
            circumstances, such as the distant fall of mighty trees in the mysterious forests
            girdling them round, the faint whoop and cry of some Indian seeking his camp, and
            unwittingly nearer to the white men's settlement than either he or they would have liked
            could they have chosen, the hungry yells of the wild beasts approaching the
            cattle-pens,—these were the things which made that winter life in Salem, in the
            memorable time of <year>1691</year>-2, seem strange, and haunted, and terrific to many:
            peculiarly weird and awful to the English girl in her first year's sojourn in
            America.</p>
        <p tone="suspenseful"> And now imagine <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> worked upon perpetually
            by <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh's</character> conviction that it was decreed that
            she should be his wife, and you will see that she was not without courage and spirit to
            resist as she did, steadily, firmly, and yet sweetly. Take one instance out of many,
            when her nerves were subjected to a shock, slight in relation it is true, but then
            remember that she had been all day, and for many days, shut up within doors, in a dull
            light, that at mid-day was almost dark with a long-continued snow-storm. Evening was
            coming on, and the wood fire was more cheerful than any of the human beings surrounding
            it; the monotonous whirr of the smaller spinning-wheels had been going on all day, and
            the store of flax down stairs was nearly exhausted, when <character ref="Grace Hickson"
                >Grace Hickson</character> bade <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> fetch
            down some more from the store-room, before the light so entirely waned away that it
            could not be found without a candle, and a candle it would be dangerous to carry into
            that apartment full of combustible materials, especially at this time of hard frost,
            when every drop of water was locked up and bound in icy hardness. So <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> went, half-shrinking from the long passage that
            led to the stairs leading up into the storeroom, for it was in this passage that the
            strange night sounds were heard, which every one had begun to notice, and speak about in
            lowered tones. She sang, however, as she went, <quote>'to keep her courage
            up'</quote>—sang, however, in a subdued voice, the evening hymn she had so often sung in
            Barford church:</p>
        <p tone="suspenseful">
            <quote>'Glory to Thee, my God, this night—'</quote></p>
        <p tone="suspenseful"> and so it was, I suppose, that she never heard the breathing or motion of any creature
            near her till, just as she was loading herself with flax to carry down, she heard some
            one—it was <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>—say close to her ear:</p>
        <p tone="serious"> <quote>'Has the voice spoken yet? Speak, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>! Has
            the voice spoken yet to thee—that speaketh to me day and night, <quote>"Marry <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>?"</quote>'</quote></p>
        <p tone="serious"> She started and turned a little sick, but spoke almost directly in a brave, clear
            manner:</p>
        <p tone="serious">
            <quote>'No! Cousin <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>. And it never
                will.'</quote></p>
        <p tone="serious">
            <quote>'Then I must wait yet longer,'</quote> he replied, hoarsely, as if to himself.
           <quote> 'But all submission—all submission.'</quote></p>
        <p tone="serious"> At last a break came upon the monotony of the long, dark winter. The parishioners once
            more raised the discussion whether—the parish extending as it did—it was not absolutely
            necessary for <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character> to have help.
            This question had been mooted once before; and then <character ref="Pastor Tappau"
                >Pastor Tappau</character> had acquiesced in the necessity, and all had gone on
            smoothly for some months after the appointment of his assistant, until a feeling had
            sprung up on the part of the elder minister, which might have been called jealousy of
            the younger, if so godly a man as <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor
                Tappau</character> could have been supposed to entertain so evil a passion. However
            that might be, two parties were speedily formed, the younger and more ardent being in
            favour of Mr. Nolan, the elder and more persistent—and, at the time, the more
            numerous—clinging to the old grey-headed, dogmatic <character>Mr. Tappau</character>, who had married them,
            baptized their children, and was to them literally as a <quote>'pillar of the
                church.'</quote> So<character> Mr. Nolan</character> left <place>Salem</place>, carrying away with him, possibly, more
            hearts than that of <character ref="Faith Hickson">Faith Hickson's</character> ; but certainly
            she had never been the same creature since.</p>
        <p tone="serious"> But now—Christmas, <year>1691</year>—one or two of the older members of the congregation
            being dead, and some who were younger men having come to settle in <place>Salem</place>—<character>Mr. Tappau</character>
            being also older, and, some charitably supposed, wiser—a fresh effort had been made, and
            <character>Mr. Nolan</character> was returning to labour in ground apparently smoothed over. <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> had taken a keen interest in all the proceedings
            for <character ref="Faith">Faith's</character> sake,—far more than the latter did for
            herself, any spectator would have said. <character ref="Faith">Faith's </character> wheel
            never went faster or slower, her thread never broke, her colour never came, her eyes
            were never uplifted with sudden interest, all the time these discussions respecting <character>Mr.
            Nolan's </character>return were going on. But <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, after
            the hint given by <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>, had found a clue to
            many a sigh and look of despairing sorrow, even without the help of <character
                ref="Nattee">Nattee's</character> improvised songs, in which, under strange
            allegories, the helpless love of her favourite was told to ears heedless of all meaning,
            except those of the tender-hearted and sympathetic <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>. Occasionally, she heard a strange chant of the old Indian
            woman's—half in her own language, half in broken English—droned over some simmering
            pipkin, from which the smell was, to say the least, unearthly. Once, on perceiving this
            odour in the keeping-room, <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character>
            suddenly exclaimed:</p>
        <p tone="serious"> <quote>'<character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> is at her heathen ways again; we shall have
            some mischief unless she is stayed.'</quote></p>
        <p tone="serious"> But <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>, moving quicker than ordinary, said
            something about putting a stop to it, and so forestalled her mother's evident intention
            of going into the kitchen. <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> shut the door
            between the two rooms, and entered upon some remonstrance with <character ref="Nattee"
                >Nattee</character>; but no one could hear the words used. <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character> and <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> seemed more bound
            together by love and common interest, than any other two among the self-contained
            individuals comprising this household. <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>
            sometimes felt as if her presence as a third interrupted some confidential talk between
            her cousin and the old servant. And yet she was fond of <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character>, and could almost think that <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character> liked her more than she did either mother, brother, or sister;
            for the first two were indifferent as to any unspoken feelings, while <character
                ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> delighted in discovering them only to make an
            amusement to herself out of them.</p>
        <p> One day <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was sitting by herself at her
            sewing table, while <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> and <character ref="Nattee"
                >Nattee</character> were holding one of the secret conclaves from which <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> felt herself to be tacitly excluded, when the
            outer door opened, and a tall, pale young man, in the strict professional habit of a
            minister, entered. <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> sprang up with a smile
            and a look of welcome for <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>'s sake, for this must
            be the Mr. Nolan whose name had been on the tongue of every one for days, and who was,
            as <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> knew, expected to arrive the day
            before.</p>
        <p> He seemed half surprised at the glad alacrity with which he was received by this
            stranger: possibly he had not heard of the English girl, who was an inmate in the house
            where formerly he had seen only grave, solemn, rigid, or heavy faces, and had been
            received with a stiff form of welcome, very different from the blushing, smiling,
            dimpled looks that innocently met him with the greeting almost of an old acquaintance.
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> having placed a chair for him,
            hastened out to call <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>, never doubting but that
            the feeling which her cousin entertained for the young pastor was mutual, although it
            might be unrecognised in its full depth by either.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'<character ref="Faith">Faith</character>!'</quote> said she, bright and
            breathless. <quote>'Guess—no,'</quote> checking herself to an assumed unconsciousness of
            any particular importance likely to be affixed to her words, 'Mr. Nolan, the new pastor,
            is in the keeping-room. He has asked for my aunt and <character ref="Manasseh"
                >Manasseh</character>. My aunt is gone to the prayer meeting at <character
                ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character><quote>'s, and <character
                    ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> is away.'</quote>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> went on speaking to give <character
                ref="Faith">Faith</character> time, for the girl had become deadly white at the
            intelligence, while, at the same time, her eyes met the keen, cunning eyes of the old
            Indian with a peculiar look of half-wondering awe, while <character ref="Nattee"
                >Nattee</character>'s looks expressed triumphant satisfaction.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Go,'</quote> said <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, smoothing
                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character><quote>'s hair, and kissing the white, cold
                cheek, '</quote>or he will wonder why no one comes to see him, and perhaps think he
            is not welcome.' <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> went without another word into
            the keeping-room, and shut the door of communication. <character ref="Nattee"
                >Nattee</character> and <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> were left
            together. <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> felt as happy as if some piece
            of good fortune had befallen herself. For the time, her growing dread of <character
                ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>'s wild, ominous persistence in his suit, her
            aunt's coldness, her own loneliness, were all forgotten, and she could almost have
            danced with joy. <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> laughed aloud, and talked
            and chuckled to herself: 'Old Indian woman great mystery. Old Indian woman sent hither
            and thither; go where she is told, where she hears with her ears. But old Indian
            woman'—and here she drew herself up, and the expression of her face quite changed—'know
            how to call, and then white man must come; and old Indian have spoken never a word, and
            white man have hear nothing with his ears.' So, the old crone muttered.</p>
        <p> All this time, things were going on very differently in the keeping-room to what
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> imagined. <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character> sat stiller even than usual; her eyes downcast, her words few. A
            quick observer might have noticed a certain tremulousness about her hands, and an
            occasional twitching throughout all her frame. But <character ref="Pastor Nolan">Pastor
                Nolan</character> was not a keen observer upon this occasion; he was absorbed with
            his own little wonders and perplexities. His wonder was that of a carnal man—who that
            pretty stranger might be, who had seemed, on his first coming, so glad to see him, but
            had vanished instantly, apparently not to reappear. And, indeed, I am not sure if his
            perplexity was not that of a carnal man rather than that of a godly minister, for this
            was his dilemma. It was the custom of Salem (as we have already seen) for the minister,
            on entering a household for the visit which, among other people and in other times,
            would have been termed a <quote>'morning call,'</quote> to put up a prayer for the
            eternal welfare of the family under whose roof-tree he was. Now this prayer was expected
            to be adapted to the individual character, joys, sorrows, wants, and failings of every
            member present; and here was he, a young pastor, alone with a young woman, and he
            thought—vain thoughts, perhaps, but still very natural—that the implied guesses at her
            character, involved in the minute supplications above described, would be very awkward
            in a tête-à-tête prayer; so, whether it was his wonder or his perplexity, I do not know,
            but he did not contribute much to the conversation for some time, and at last, by a
            sudden burst of courage and impromptu hit, he cut the Gordian knot by making the usual
            proposal for prayer, and adding to it a request that the household might be summoned. In
            came <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, quiet and decorous; in came
                <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character>, all one impassive, stiff piece of
            wood,—no look of intelligence or trace of giggling near her countenance. Solemnly
            recalling each wandering thought, <character ref="Pastor Nolan">Pastor Nolan</character>
            knelt in the midst of these three to pray. He was a good and truly religious man, whose
            name here is the only thing disguised, and played his part bravely in the awful trial to
            which he was afterwards subjected; and if at the time, before he went through his fiery
            persecutions, the human fancies which beset all young hearts came across his, we at this
            day know that these fancies are no sin. But now he prays in earnest, prays so heartily
            for himself, with such a sense of his own spiritual need and spiritual failings, that
            each one of his hearers feels as if a prayer and a supplication had gone up for each of
            them. Even <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> muttered the few words she knew of
            the Lord's Prayer; gibberish though the disjointed nouns and verbs might be, the poor
            creature said them because she was stirred to unwonted reverence. As for <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, she rose up comforted and strengthened, as no
            special prayers of <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character> had ever
            made her feel. But <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> was sobbing, sobbing aloud,
            almost hysterically, and made no effort to rise, but lay on her outstretched arms spread
            out upon the settle. <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> and <character
                ref="Pastor Nolan">Pastor Nolan</character> looked at each other for an instant.
            Then <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> said:</p>
        <p> 'Sir, you must go. My cousin has not been strong for some time, and doubtless she needs
            more quiet than she has had to-day.'</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Pastor Nolan">Pastor Nolan</character> bowed, and left the house; but in
            a moment he returned. Half opening the door, but without entering, he said:</p>
        <p> 'I come back to ask, if perchance I may call this evening to inquire how young Mistress
            Hickson finds herself?'</p>
        <p> But <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> did not hear this; she was sobbing louder
            than ever.</p>
        <p> 'Why did you send him away, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>? I should
            have been better directly, and it is so long since I have seen him.'</p>
        <p> She had her face hidden as she uttered these words, and <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> could not hear them distinctly. She bent her head down by her
            cousin's on the settle, meaning to ask her to repeat what she had said. But in the
            irritation of the moment, and prompted possibly by some incipient jealousy, <character
                ref="Faith">Faith</character> pushed <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>
            away so violently that the latter was hurt against the hard, sharp corner of the wooden
            settle. Tears came into her eyes; not so much because her cheek was bruised, as because
            of the surprised pain she felt at this repulse from the cousin towards whom she was
            feeling so warmly and kindly. Just for the moment, <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> was as angry as any child could have been; but some of the words
            of Pastor Nolan's prayer yet rang in her ears, and she thought it would be a shame if
            she did not let them sink into her heart. She dared not, however, stoop again to caress
                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>, but stood quietly by her, sorrowfully
            waiting, until a step at the outer door caused <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>
            to rise quickly, and rush into the kitchen, leaving <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> to bear the brunt of the new-comer. It was <character
                ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>, returned from hunting. He had been two days
            away, in company with other young men belonging to Salem. It was almost the only
            occupation which could draw him out of his secluded habits. He stopped suddenly at the
            door on seeing <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, and alone, for she had
            avoided him of late in every possible way.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Where is my mother?'</quote></p>
        <p>
            <quote>'At a prayer meeting at <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor
                Tappau</character>'</quote>s. She has taken <character ref="Prudence"
                >Prudence</character>. <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> has left the room
            this minute. I will call her.' And <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was
            going towards the kitchen, when he placed himself between her and the door.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'<character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,'</quote> said he, 'the time is
            going by, and I cannot wait much longer. The visions come thick upon me, and my sight
            grows clearer and clearer. Only this last night, camping out in the woods, I saw in my
            soul, between sleeping and waking, the spirit come and offer thee two lots, and the
            colour of the one was white, like a bride's, and the other was black and red, which is,
            being interpreted, a violent death. And when thou didst choose the latter the spirit
            said unto me, <quote>'Come!'</quote> and I came, and did as I was bidden. I put it on
            thee with mine own hands, as it is preordained, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice
            and be my wife. And when the black and red dress fell to the ground, thou wert even as a
            corpse three days old. Now, be advised, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,
            in time. <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, my cousin, I have seen it in a
            vision, and my soul cleaveth unto thee—I would fain spare thee.'</p>
        <p> He was really in earnest—in passionate earnest; whatever his visions, as he called them,
            might be, he believed in them, and this belief gave something of unselfishness to his
            love for <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>. This she felt at this moment,
            if she had never done so before, and it seemed like a contrast to the repulse she had
            just met with from his sister. He had drawn near her, and now he took hold of her hand,
            repeating in his wild, pathetic, dreamy way:</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'And the voice said unto me, "Marry <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                    >Lois</character>!"'</quote> And <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>
            was more inclined to soothe and reason with him than she had ever been before, since the
            first time of his speaking to her on the subject,—when <character ref="Grace Hickson"
                >Grace Hickson</character>—and <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>
            entered the room from the passage. They had returned from the prayer meeting by the back
            way, which had prevented the sound of their approach from being heard.</p>
        <p> But <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> did not stir or look round; he kept
            his eyes fixed on <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, as if to note the
            effect of his words. Grace came hastily forwards, and lifting up her strong right arm,
            smote their joined hands in twain, in spite of the fervour of <character ref="Manasseh"
                >Manasseh</character>'s grasp.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'What means this?'</quote> said she, addressing herself more to <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> than to her son, anger flashing out of her
            deep-set eyes.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> waited for <character ref="Manasseh"
                >Manasseh</character> to speak. He seemed, but a few minutes before, to be more
            gentle and less threatening than he had been of late on this subject, and she did not
            wish to irritate him. But he did not speak, and her aunt stood angrily waiting for an
            answer.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'At any rate,'</quote> thought <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,
            'it will put an end to the thought in his mind when my aunt speaks out about it.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'My cousin seeks me in marriage,'</quote> said <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Thee!'</quote> and Grace struck out in the direction of her niece with a gesture
            of supreme contempt. But now <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> spoke
            forth:</p>
        <p> 'Yea! it is preordained. The voice has said it, and the spirit has brought her to me as
            my bride.'</p>
        <p> 'Spirit! an evil spirit then. A good spirit would have chosen out for thee a godly
            maiden of thine own people, and not a prelatist and a stranger like this girl. A pretty
            return, Mistress <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, for all our
            kindness.'</p>
        <p> 'Indeed, Aunt Hickson, I have done all I could—Cousin <character ref="Manasseh"
                >Manasseh</character> knows it—to show him I can be none of his. I have told him,'
            said she, blushing, but determined to say the whole out at once, 'that I am all but
            troth-plight to a young man of our own village at home; and, even putting all that on
            one side, I wish not for marriage at present.'</p>
        <p> 'Wish rather for conversion and regeneration. Marriage is an unseemly word in the mouth
            of a maiden. As for <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>, I will take reason
            with him in private; and, meanwhile, if thou hast spoken truly, throw not thyself in his
            path, as I have noticed thou hast done but too often of late.'</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>'s heart burnt within her at this unjust
            accusation, for she knew how much she had dreaded and avoided her cousin, and she almost
            looked to him to give evidence that her aunt's last words were not true. But, instead,
            he recurred to his one fixed idea, and said:</p>
        <p> 'Mother, listen! If I wed not <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, both she
            and I die within the year. I care not for life; before this, as you know, I have sought
            for death' (Grace shuddered, and was for a moment subdued by some recollection of past
            horror); 'but if <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> were my wife I should
            live, and she would be spared from what is the other lot. That whole vision grows
            clearer to me day by day. Yet, when I try to know whether I am one of the elect, all is
            dark. The mystery of Free-Will and Fore-Knowledge is a mystery of Satan's devising, not

        <p> This, then, was the secret explanation of much that had alarmed her in her cousin's
            manner: and if <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> had been a physician of
            modern times, she might have traced somewhat of the same temperament in his sisters as
            well—in <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>'s lack of natural feeling and
            impish delight in mischief, in <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>'s vehemence of
            unrequited love. But as yet <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> did not know,
            any more than <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>, that the attachment of the
            latter to Mr. Nolan was not merely unreturned, but even unperceived, by the young
            minister.</p>
        <p> He came, it is true—came often to the house, sat long with the family, and watched them
            narrowly, but took no especial notice of <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>.
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> perceived this, and grieved over it;
                <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> perceived it, and was indignant at it,
            long before <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> slowly acknowledged it to herself,
            and went to <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> the Indian woman, rather than to
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> her cousin, for sympathy and
            counsel.</p>

            all the moss and the feathers? Wait till the Indian has found means to send the old bird

                >Nattee</character> gave.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character> took some kind of charge over
                <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> that relieved <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> of much of her distress at his strange
            behaviour. Yet at times he escaped from his mother's watchfulness, and in such
            opportunities he would always seek <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,
            entreating her, as of old, to marry him—sometimes pleading his love for her, oftener
            speaking wildly of his visions and the voices which he heard foretelling a terrible
            futurity.</p>
        <p> We have now to do with events which were taking place in Salem, beyond the narrow circle
            of the Hickson family; but as they only concern us in as far as they bore down in their
            consequences on the future of those who formed part of it, I shall go over the narrative
            very briefly. The town of Salem had lost by death, within a very short time preceding
            the commencement of my story, nearly all its venerable men and leading citizens—men of
            ripe wisdom and sound counsel. The people had hardly yet recovered from the shock of
            their loss, as one by one the patriarchs of the primitive little community had rapidly
            followed each other to the grave. They had been beloved as fathers, and looked up to as
            judges in the land. The first bad effect of their loss was seen in the heated dissension
            which sprang up between <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character> and the
            candidate Nolan. It had been apparently healed over; but Mr. Nolan had not been many
            weeks in Salem, after his second coming, before the strife broke out afresh, and
            alienated many for life who had till then been bound together by the ties of friendship
            or relationship. Even in the Hickson family something of this feeling soon sprang up;
            Grace being a vehement partisan of the elder pastor's more gloomy doctrines, while
                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> was a passionate, if a powerless, advocate
            of Mr. Nolan. <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>'s growing absorption in his
            own fancies, and imagined gift of prophecy, making him comparatively indifferent to all
            outward events, did not tend to either the fulfilment of his visions, or the elucidation
            of the dark mysterious doctrines over which he had pondered too long for the health
            either of his mind or body; while <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>
            delighted in irritating every one by her advocacy of the views of thinking to which they
            were most opposed, and retailing every gossiping story to the person most likely to
            disbelieve, and be indignant at what she told, with an assumed unconsciousness of any
            such effect to be produced. There was much talk of the congregational difficulties and
            dissensions being carried up to the general court, and each party naturally hoped that,
            if such were the course of events, the opposing pastor and that portion of the
            congregation which adhered to him might be worsted in the struggle.</p>
        <p> Such was the state of things in the township when, one day towards the end of the month
            of February, <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character> returned from the
            weekly prayer meeting; which it was her custom to attend at <character
                ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character>'s house, in a state of extreme
            excitement. On her entrance into her own house she sat down, rocking her body backwards
            and forwards, and praying to herself: both <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> and
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> stopped their spinning, in wonder at
            her agitation, before either of them ventured to address her. At length <character
                ref="Faith">Faith</character> rose, and spoke:</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Mother, what is it? Hath anything happened of an evil nature?'</quote></p>
        <p> The brave, stern, old woman's face was blenched, and her eyes were almost set in horror,
            as she prayed; the great drops running down her cheeks.</p>
        <p> It seemed almost as if she had to make a struggle to recover her sense of the present
            homely accustomed life, before she could find words to answer:</p>
        <p> 'Evil nature! Daughters, Satan is abroad,—is close to us. I have this very hour seen him
            afflict two innocent children, as of old he troubled those who were possessed by him in
            Judea. Hester and <character ref="Abigail Tappau">Abigail Tappau</character> have been
            contorted and convulsed by him and his servants into such shapes as I am afeard to think
            on; and when their father, godly Mr. Tappau, began to exhort and to pray, their howlings
            were like the wild beasts of the field. Satan is of a truth let loose amongst us. The
            girls kept calling upon him as if he were even then present among us. <character
                ref="Abigail Tappau">Abigail</character> screeched out that he stood at my very back
            in the guise of a black man; and truly, as I turned round at her words, I saw a creature
            like a shadow vanishing, and turned all of a cold sweat. Who knows where he is now?
                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>, lay straws across on the door-sill.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'But if he be already entered in,'</quote> asked <character ref="Prudence"
                >Prudence</character>, 'may not that make it difficult for him to depart?'</p>
        <p> Her mother, taking no notice of her question, went on rocking herself, and praying, till
            again she broke out into narration:</p>
        <p> 'Reverend Mr. Tappau says, that only last night he heard a sound as of a heavy body
            dragged all through the house by some strong power; once it was thrown against his
            bedroom door, and would, doubtless, have broken it in, if he had not prayed fervently
            and aloud at that very time; and a shriek went up at his prayer that made his hair stand
            on end; and this morning all the crockery in the house was found broken and piled up in
            the middle of the kitchen floor; and <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor
                Tappau</character> says, that as soon as he began to ask a blessing on the morning's
            meal, <character ref="Abigail Tappau">Abigail</character> and Hester cried out, as if
            some one was pinching them. Lord, have mercy upon us all! Satan is of a truth let
            loose.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'They sound like the old stories I used to hear in Barford,'</quote> said
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, breathless with affright.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> seemed less alarmed; but then her dislike to
                <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character> was so great, that she
            could hardly sympathise with any misfortunes that befell him or his family.</p>
        <p> Towards evening Mr. Nolan came in. In general, so high did party spirit run, Grace
            Hickson only tolerated his visits, finding herself often engaged at such hours, and
            being too much abstracted in thought to show him the ready hospitality which was one of
            her most prominent virtues. But to-day, both as bringing the latest intelligence of the
            new horrors sprung up in Salem, and as being one of the Church militant (or what the
            Puritans considered as equivalent to the Church militant) against Satan, he was welcomed
            by her in an unusual manner.</p>
        <p> He seemed oppressed with the occurrences of the day: at first it appeared to be almost a
            relief to him to sit still, and cogitate upon them, and his hosts were becoming almost
            impatient for him to say something more than mere monosyllables, when he began:</p>
        <p> 'Such a day as this, I pray that I may never see again. It is as if the devils whom our
            Lord banished into the herd of swine, had been permitted to come again upon the earth.
            And I would it were only the lost spirits who were tormenting us; but I much fear, that
            certain of those whom we have esteemed as God's people have sold their souls to Satan,
            for the sake of a little of his evil power, whereby they may afflict others for a time.

            day a good and valuable horse, wherewith he used to drive his family to meeting, his
            wife being bedridden.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Perchance,'</quote> said <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,
                <quote>'the horse died of some natural disease.'</quote></p>
        <p>
            <quote>'True,'</quote> said <character ref="Pastor Nolan">Pastor Nolan</character>; 'but
            I was going on to say, that as he entered into his house, full of dolour at the loss of
            his beast, a mouse ran in before him so sudden that it almost tripped him up, though an
            instant before there was no such thing to be seen; and he caught at it with his shoe and
            hit it, and it cried out like a human creature in pain, and straight ran up the chimney,
            caring nothing for the hot flame and smoke.'</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> listened greedily to all this story, and
            when it was ended he smote upon his breast, and prayed aloud for deliverance from the
            power of the Evil One; and he continually went on praying at intervals through the
            evening, with every mark of abject terror on his face and in his manner—he, the bravest,
            most daring hunter in all the settlement. Indeed, all the family huddled together in
            silent fear, scarcely finding any interest in the usual household occupations.
                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> and <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> sat with arms entwined, as in days before the former had become
            jealous of the latter; <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> asked low, fearful
            questions of her mother and of the pastor as to the creatures that were abroad, and the
            ways in which they afflicted others; and when Grace besought the minister to pray for
            her and her household, he made a long and passionate supplication that none of that
            little flock might ever so far fall away into hopeless perdition as to be guilty of the
            sin without forgiveness—the sin of Witchcraft.</p>
    </chapter>
    <chapter n="3">Chapter 3 <p>
            <quote>'The sin of witchcraft.'</quote> We read about it, we look on it from the
            outside; but we can hardly realize the terror it induced. Every impulsive or
            unaccustomed action, every little nervous affection, every ache or pain was noticed, not
            merely by those around the sufferer, but by the person himself, whoever he might be,
            that was acting, or being acted upon, in any but the most simple and ordinary manner. He
            or she (for it was most frequently a woman or girl that was the supposed subject) felt a
            desire for some unusual kind of food—some unusual motion or rest her hand twitched, her
            foot was asleep, or her leg had the cramp; and the dreadful question immediately
            suggested itself, <quote>'Is any one possessing an evil power over me, by the help of
                Satan?'</quote> and perhaps they went on to think, 'It is bad enough to feel that my
            body can be made to suffer through the power of some unknown evil-wisher to me, but what
            if Satan gives them still further power, and they can touch my soul, and inspire me with
            loathful thoughts leading me into crimes which at present I abhor?' and so on, till the
            very dread of what might happen, and the constant dwelling of the thoughts, even with
            horror, upon certain possibilities, or what were esteemed such, really brought about the
            corruption of imagination at least, which at first they had shuddered at. Moreover,
            there was a sort of uncertainty as to who might be infected—not unlike the overpowering
            dread of the plague, which made some shrink from their best-beloved with irrepressible
            fear. The brother or sister, who was the dearest friend of their childhood and youth,
            might now be bound in some mysterious deadly pact with evil spirits of the most horrible
            kind—who could tell? And in such a case it became a duty, a sacred duty, to give up the
            earthly body which had been once so loved, but which was now the habitation of a soul
            corrupt and horrible in its evil inclinations. Possibly, terror of death might bring on
            confession and repentance, and purification. Or if it did not, why away with the evil
            creature, the witch, out of the world, down to the kingdom of the master, whose bidding
            was done on earth in all manner of corruption and torture of God's creatures! There were
            others who, to these more simple, if more ignorant, feelings of horror at witches and
            witchcraft, added the desire, conscious or unconscious, of revenge on those whose
            conduct had been in any way displeasing to them. Where evidence takes a supernatural
            character, there is no disproving it. This argument comes up: 'You have only the natural
            powers; I have supernatural. You admit the existence of the supernatural by the
            condemnation of this very crime of witchcraft. You hardly know the limits of the natural
            powers; how then can you define the supernatural? I say that in the dead of night, when
            my body seemed to all present to be lying in quiet sleep, I was, in the most complete
            and wakeful consciousness, present in my body at an assembly of witches and wizards with
            Satan at their head; that I was by them tortured in my body, because my soul would not
            acknowledge him as its king; and that I witnessed such and such deeds. What the nature
            of the appearance was that took the semblance of myself, sleeping quietly in my bed, I
            know not; but admitting, as you do, the possibility of witchcraft, you cannot disprove
            my evidence.' This evidence might be given truly or falsely, as the person witnessing
            believed it or not; but every one must see what immense and terrible power was abroad
            for revenge. Then, again, the accused themselves ministered to the horrible panic
            abroad. Some, in dread of death, confessed from cowardice to the imaginary crimes of
            which they were accused, and of which they were promised a pardon on confession. Some,
            weak and terrified, came honestly to believe in their own guilt, through the diseases of
            imagination which were sure to be engendered at such a time as this.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> sat spinning with <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character>. Both were silent, pondering over the stories that were abroad.
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> spoke first.</p>
        <p> 'Oh, <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>! this country is worse than ever England
            was, even in the days of Master Matthew Hopkins, the witch-finder. I grow frightened of
            every one, I think. I even get afeard sometimes of <character ref="Nattee"
                >Nattee</character>!'</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> coloured a little. Then she asked,</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Why? What should make you distrust the Indian woman?'</quote></p>
        <p> 'Oh! I am ashamed of my fear as soon as it arises in my mind. But, you know, her look
            and colour were strange to me when first I came; and she is not a christened woman; and
            they tell stories of Indian wizards; and I know not what the mixtures are which she is
            sometimes stirring over the fire, nor the meaning of the strange chants she sings to
            herself. And once I met her in the dusk, just close by <character ref="Pastor Tappau"
                >Pastor Tappau</character>'s house, in company with Hota, his servant—it was just
            before we heard of the sore disturbance in his house—and I have wondered if she had
            aught to do with it.'</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> sat very still, as if thinking. At last she
            said:</p>
        <p> 'If <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> has powers beyond what you and I have,
            she will not use them for evil; at least not evil to those whom she loves.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'That comforts me but little,'</quote> said <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>. 'If she has powers beyond what she ought to have, I dread her,
            though I have done her no evil; nay, though I could almost say she bore me a kindly
            feeling. But such powers are only given by the Evil One; and the proof thereof is, that,
            as you imply, <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> would use them on those who
            offend her.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'And why should she not?'</quote> asked <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>,
            lifting her eyes, and flashing heavy fire out of them at the question.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Because,'</quote> said <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, not
            seeing <character ref="Faith">Faith</character><quote>'s glance, '</quote>we are told to

            Mr. Nolan would baptize her; it would, maybe, take her out of the power of

        <p>
            <quote>'Are you never tempted?'</quote> asked <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>,
            half scornfully; 'and yet I doubt not you were well baptized!'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'True,'</quote> said <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, sadly; 'I
            often do very wrong, but, perhaps, I might have done worse, if the holy form had not
            been observed.'</p>

        <p> 'As you will, cowardly girl, full of terrors, which, if you had listened to me, might
            have been lessened, if not entirely done away with.' And <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character> would not utter another word, though <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> tried meekly to entice her into conversation on
            some other subject.</p>
        <p> The rumour of witchcraft was like the echo of thunder among the hills. It had broken out
            in Mr. Tappau's house, and his two little daughters were the first supposed to be
            bewitched; but round about, from every quarter of the town, came in accounts of
            sufferers by witchcraft. There was hardly a family without one of these supposed
            victims. Then arose a growl and menaces of vengeance from many a household—menaces
            deepened, not daunted by the terror and mystery of the suffering that gave rise to
            them.</p>
        <p> At length a day was appointed when, after solemn fasting and prayer, Mr. Tappau invited
            the neighbouring ministers and all godly people to assemble at his house, and unite with
            him in devoting a day to solemn religious services, and to supplication for the
            deliverance of his children, and those similarly afflicted, from the power of the Evil
            One. All Salem poured out towards the house of the minister. There was a look of
            excitement on all their faces; eagerness and horror were depicted on many, while stern
            resolution, amounting to determined cruelty, if the occasion arose, was seen on
            others.</p>
        <p> In the midst of the prayer, <character ref="Hester Tappau">Hester Tappau</character>,
            the younger girl, fell into convulsions; fit after fit came on, and her screams mingled
            with the shrieks and cries of the assembled congregation. In the first pause, when the
            child was partially recovered, when the people stood around exhausted and breathless,
            her father, the <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character>, lifted his
            right hand, and adjured her, in the name of the Trinity, to say who tormented her. There
            was a dead silence; not a creature stirred of all those hundreds. Hester turned wearily
            and uneasily, and moaned out the name of Hota, her father's Indian servant. Hota was
            present, apparently as much interested as any one; indeed, she had been busying herself
            much in bringing remedies to the suffering child. But now she stood aghast, transfixed,
            while her name was caught up and shouted out in tones of reprobation and hatred by all
            the crowd around her. Another moment and they would have fallen upon the trembling
            creature and torn her limb from limb—pale, dusky, shivering Hota, half guilty-looking
            from her very bewilderment. But <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor
            Tappau</character>, that gaunt, grey man, lifting himself to his utmost height, signed
            to them to go back, to keep still while he addressed them; and then he told them, that
            instant vengeance was not just, deliberate punishment; that there would be need of
            conviction, perchance of confession—he hoped for some redress for his suffering children
            from her revelations, if she were brought to confession. They must leave the culprit in
            his hands, and in those of his brother ministers, that they might wrestle with Satan
            before delivering her up to the civil power. He spoke well, for he spoke from the heart
            of a father seeing his children exposed to dreadful and mysterious suffering, and firmly
            believing that he now held the clue in his hand which should ultimately release them and
            their fellow-sufferers. And the congregation moaned themselves into unsatisfied
            submission, and listened to his long, passionate prayer, which he uplifted even while
            the hapless Hota stood there, guarded and bound by two men, who glared at her like
            bloodhounds ready to slip, even while the prayer ended in the words of the merciful
            Saviour.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> sickened and shuddered at the whole
            scene; and this was no intellectual shuddering at the folly and superstition of the
            people, but tender moral shuddering at the sight of guilt which she believed in, and at
            the evidence of men's hatred and abhorrence, which, when shown even to the guilty,
            troubled and distressed her merciful heart. She followed her aunt and cousins out into
            the open air, with downcast eyes and pale face. Grace Hickson was going home with a
            feeling of triumphant relief at the detection of the guilty one. <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character> alone seemed uneasy and disturbed beyond her wont, for <character
                ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> received the whole transaction as the fulfilment
            of a prophecy, and <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> was excited by the
            novel scene into a state of discordant high spirits.</p>

            <quote>'I am quite as old as <character ref="Hester Tappau">Hester

        <p>
            <quote>'What has that to do with it?'</quote> said <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character>, sharply.</p>
        <p> 'Nothing, only she seemed such a little thing for all those grave ministers to be
            praying for, and so many folk come from a distance—some from Boston they said—all for
            her sake, as it were. Why, didst thou see, it was godly Mr. Henwick that held her head
            when he wriggled so, and old Madam Holbrook had herself helped upon a chair to see the
            better. I wonder how long I might wriggle, before great and godly folk would take so
            much notice of me? But, I suppose, that comes of being a pastor<quote>'s daughter.

                Tappau</character>'s, just like any other woman, only, perchance, a trifle more
            good-natured; and to think of her being a witch after all!'</p>
        <p> But <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> seemed in a hurry to reach home, paid no
            attention to <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>'s talking. <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> hastened on with <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character>, for <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> was walking
            alongside of his mother, and she kept steady to her plan of avoiding him, even though
            she pressed her company upon <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>, who had seemed of
            late desirous of avoiding her.</p>
        <p> That evening the news spread through Salem, that Hota had confessed her sin—had
            acknowledged that she was a witch. <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> was the
            first to hear the intelligence. She broke into the room where the girls were sitting
            with <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character>, solemnly doing nothing,
            because of the great prayer-meeting in the morning, and cried out, 'Mercy, mercy,
            mistress, everybody! take care of poor Indian <character ref="Nattee"
            >Nattee</character>, who never do wrong, but for mistress and the family! Hota one bad
            wicked witch, she say so herself; oh, me! oh me!' and stooping over <character
                ref="Faith">Faith</character>, she said something in a low, miserable tone of voice,
            of which <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> only heard the word
                <quote>'torture.'</quote> But <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> heard all,
            and turning very pale, half accompanied, half led <character ref="Nattee"
                >Nattee</character> back to her kitchen.</p>
        <p> Presently, <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character> came in. She had
            been out to see a neighbour; it will not do to say that so godly a woman had been
            gossiping; and, indeed, the subject of the conversation she had held was of too serious
            and momentous a nature for me to employ a light word to designate it. There was all the
            listening to and repeating of small details and rumours, in which the speakers have no
            concern, that constitutes gossiping; but in this instance, all trivial facts and
            speeches might be considered to bear such dreadful significance, and might have so
            ghastly an ending, that such whispers were occasionally raised to a tragic importance.
            Every fragment of intelligence that related to Mr. Tappau's household was eagerly
            snatched at; how his dog howled all one long night through, and could not be stilled;
            how his cow suddenly failed in her milk only two months after she had calved; how his
            memory had forsaken him one morning, for a minute or two, in repeating the Lord's
            Prayer, and he had even omitted a clause thereof in his sudden perturbation; and how all
            these forerunners of his children's strange illness might now be interpreted and
            understood—this had formed the staple of the conversation between <character
                ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character> and her friends. There had arisen a
            dispute among them at last, as to how far these subjections to the power of the Evil One
            were to be considered as a judgment upon <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor
                Tappau</character> for some sin on his part; and if so, what? It was not an
            unpleasant discussion, although there was considerable difference of opinion; for as
            none of the speakers had had their families so troubled, it was rather a proof that they
            had none of them committed any sin. In the midst of this talk, one, entering in from the
            street, brought the news that Hota had confessed all—had owned to signing a certain
            little red book which Satan had presented to her—had been present at impious
            sacraments—had ridden through the air to Newbury Falls—and, in fact, had assented to all
            the questions which the elders and magistrates, carefully reading over the confessions
            of the witches who had formerly been tried in England, in order that they might not omit
            a single inquiry, had asked of her. More she had owned to, but things of inferior
            importance, and partaking more of the nature of earthly tricks than of spiritual power.
            She had spoken of carefully adjusted strings, by which all the crockery in Pastor
            Tappau's house could be pulled down or disturbed; but of such intelligible malpractices
            the gossips of Salem took little heed. One of them said that such an action showed
            Satan's prompting, but they all preferred to listen to the grander guilt of the
            blasphemous sacraments and supernatural rides. The narrator ended with saying that Hota
            was to be hung the next morning, in spite of her confession, even although her life had
            been promised to her if she acknowledged her sin; for it was well to make an example of
            the first-discovered witch, and it was also well that she was an Indian, a heathen,
            whose life would be no great loss to the community. <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace
                Hickson</character> on this spoke out. It was well that witches should perish off
            the face of the earth, Indian or English, heathen or, worse, a baptized Christian who
            had betrayed the Lord, even as Judas did, and had gone over to Satan. For her part, she
            wished that the first-discovered witch had been a member of a godly English household,
            that it might be seen of all men that religious folk were willing to cut off the right
            hand, and pluck out the right eye, if tainted with this devilish sin. She spoke sternly
            and well. The last comer said, that her words might be brought to the proof, for it had
            been whispered that Hota had named others, and some from the most religious families of
            Salem, whom she had seen among the unholy communicants at the sacrament of the Evil One.
            And Grace replied that she would answer for it, all godly folk would stand the proof,
            and quench all natural affection rather than that such a sin should grow and spread
            among them. She herself had a weak bodily dread of witnessing the violent death even of
            an animal; but she would not let that deter her from standing amidst those who cast the
            accursed creature out from among them on the morrow morning.</p>
        <p> Contrary to her wont, <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character> told her
            family much of this conversation. It was a sign of her excitement on the subject that
            she thus spoke, and the excitement spread in different forms through her family.
                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> was flushed and restless, wandering between
            the keeping-room and the kitchen, and questioning her mother particularly as to the more
            extraordinary parts of Hota's confession, as if she wished to satisfy herself that the
            Indian witch had really done those horrible and mysterious deeds.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> shivered and trembled with affright at
            the narration, and the idea that such things were possible. Occasionally she found
            herself wandering off into sympathetic thought for the woman who was to die, abhorred of
            all men, and unpardoned by God, to whom she had been so fearful a traitor, and who was
            now, at this very time—when <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> sat among her
            kindred by the warm and cheerful firelight, anticipating many peaceful, perchance happy,
            morrows—solitary, shivering, panic-stricken, guilty, with none to stand by her and
            exhort her, shut up in darkness between the cold walls of the town prison. But
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> almost shrank from sympathising with
            so loathsome an accomplice of Satan, and prayed for forgiveness for her charitable
            thought; and yet, again, she remembered the tender spirit of the Saviour, and allowed
            herself to fall into pity, till at last her sense of right and wrong became so
            bewildered that she could only leave all to God's disposal, and just ask that He would
            take all creatures and all events into His hands.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> was as bright as if she were listening to
            some merry story—curious as to more than her mother would tell her—seeming to have no
            particular terror of witches or witchcraft, and yet to be especially desirous to
            accompany her mother the next morning to the hanging. <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> shrank from the cruel, eager face of the young girl as she begged
            her mother to allow her to go. Even Grace was disturbed and perplexed by her daughter's
            pertinacity.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'No!'</quote> said she. 'Ask me no more. Thou shalt not go. Such sights are not
            for the young. I go, and I sicken at the thoughts of it. But I go to show that I, a
            Christian woman, take God<quote>'s part against the devil'</quote>s. Thou shalt not go,
            I tell thee. I could whip thee for thinking of it.'</p>
        <p> '<character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> says Hota was well whipped by <character
                ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character> ere she was brought to confession,'
            said <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>, as if anxious to change the subject
            of discussion.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> lifted up his head from the great folio
            Bible, brought by his father from England, which he was studying. He had not heard what
                <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> said, but he looked up at the sound
            of his name. All present were startled at his wild eyes, his bloodless face. But he was
            evidently annoyed at the expression of their countenances.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Why look ye at me in that manner?'</quote> asked he. And his manner was anxious
            and agitated. His mother made haste to speak:</p>
        <p> 'It was but that <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> said something that thou
            hast told her—that <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character> defiled his
            hands by whipping the witch Hota. What evil thought has got hold of thee? Talk to us,
            and crack not thy skull against the learning of man.'</p>
        <p> 'It is not the learning of man that I study: it is the word of God. I would fain know
            more of the nature of this sin of witchcraft, and whether it be, indeed, the
            unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost. At times I feel a creeping influence coming
            over me, prompting all evil thoughts and unheard-of deeds, and I question within myself,
            "Is not this the power of witchcraft?" and I sicken, and loathe all that I do or say,
            and yet some evil creature hath the mastery over me, and I must needs do and say what I
            loathe and dread. Why wonder you, mother, that I, of all men, strive to learn the exact
            nature of witchcraft, and for that end study the word of God? Have you not seen me when
            I was, as it were, possessed with a devil?'</p>
        <p> He spoke calmly, sadly, but as under deep conviction. His mother rose to comfort
            him.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'My son,'</quote> she said, 'no one ever saw thee do deeds, or heard thee utter
            words, which any one could say were prompted by devils. We have seen thee, poor lad,
            with thy wits gone astray for a time, but all thy thoughts sought rather God's will in
            forbidden places, than lost the clue to them for one moment in hankering after the
            powers of darkness. Those days are long past; a future lies before thee. Think not of
            witches or of being subject to the power of witchcraft. I did evil to speak of it before
            thee. Let <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> come and sit by thee, and talk
            to thee.'</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> went to her cousin, grieved at heart for
            his depressed state of mind, anxious to soothe and comfort him, and yet recoiling more
            than ever from the idea of ultimately becoming his wife—an idea to which she saw her
            aunt reconciling herself unconsciously day by day, as she perceived the English girl's
            power of soothing and comforting her cousin, even by the very tones of her sweet cooing
            voice.</p>
        <p> He took <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>'s hand.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Let me hold it. It does me good,'</quote> said he. 'Ah, <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, when I am by you I forget all my troubles—will
            the day never come when you will listen to the voice that speaks to me continually?'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'I never hear it, Cousin <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>,'</quote>
            she said, softly; 'but do not think of the voices. Tell me of the land you hope to
            enclose from the forest—what manner of trees grow on it?'</p>
        <p> Thus, by simple questions on practical affairs, she led him back, in her unconscious
            wisdom, to the subjects on which he had always shown strong practical sense. He talked
            on these with all due discretion till the hour for family prayer came round, which was
            early in those days. It was <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>'s place to
            conduct it, as head of the family; a post which his mother had always been anxious to
            assign to him since her husband's death. He prayed extempore; and to-night his
            supplications wandered off into wild, unconnected fragments of prayer, which all those
            kneeling around began, each according to her anxiety for the speaker, to think would
            never end. Minutes elapsed, and grew to quarters of an hour, and his words only became
            more emphatic and wilder, praying for himself alone, and laying bare the recesses of his
            heart. At length his mother rose, and took <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> by the hand, for she had faith in <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>'s power over her son, as being akin to that which the shepherd
            David, playing on his harp, had over king Saul sitting on his throne. She drew her
            towards him, where he knelt facing into the circle, with his eyes upturned, and the
            tranced agony of his face depicting the struggle of the troubled soul within.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Here is <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,'</quote> said Grace,
            almost tenderly; <quote>'she would fain go to her chamber.'</quote> (Down the
                girl<quote>'s face the tears were streaming.) '</quote>Rise, and finish thy prayer
            in thy closet.'</p>
        <p> But at <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>'s approach he sprang to his
            feet,—sprang aside.</p>
        <p> 'Take her away, mother! Lead me not into temptation. She brings me evil and sinful
            thoughts. She overshadows me, even in the presence of my God. She is no angel of light,
            or she would not do this. She troubles me with the sound of a voice bidding me marry
            her, even when I am at my prayers. Avaunt! Take her away!'</p>
        <p> He would have struck at <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> if she had not
            shrunk back, dismayed and affrighted. His mother, although equally dismayed, was not
            affrighted. She had seen him thus before; and understood the management of his
            paroxysm.</p>
        <p> 'Go, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>! the sight of thee irritates him, as
            once that of <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> did. Leave him to me.'</p>
        <p> And <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> rushed away to her room, and threw
            herself on her bed, like a panting, hunted creature. <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character> came after her slowly and heavily.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'<character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,'</quote> said she, 'wilt thou do
            me a favour? It is not much to ask. Wilt thou arise before daylight, and bear this
            letter from me to <character ref="Pastor Nolan">Pastor Nolan</character>'s lodgings? I
            would have done it myself, but mother has bidden me to come to her, and I may be
            detained until the time when Hota is to be hung; and the letter tells of matters
            pertaining to life and death. Seek out <character ref="Pastor Nolan">Pastor
                Nolan</character> wherever he may be, and have speech of him after he has read the
            letter.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Cannot <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> take it?'</quote> asked
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'No!'</quote>
            <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> answered, fiercely. <quote>'Why should
                she?'</quote></p>
        <p> But <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> did not reply. A quick suspicion
            darted through <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>'s mind, sudden as lightning. It
            had never entered there before.</p>
        <p> 'Speak, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>. I read thy thoughts. Thou
            wouldst fain not be the bearer of this letter?'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'I will take it,'</quote> said <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,
            meekly. <quote>'It concerns life and death, you say?'</quote></p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Yes!'</quote> said <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>, in quite a
            different tone of voice. But, after a pause of thought, she added: 'Then, as soon as the
            house is still, I will write what I have to say, and leave it here, on this chest; and
            thou wilt promise me to take it before the day is fully up, while there is yet time for
            action.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Yes! I promise,'</quote> said <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>.
            And <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> knew enough of her to feel sure that the
            deed would be done, however reluctantly.</p>
        <p> The letter was written—laid on the chest; and, ere day dawned, <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was astir, <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character> watching her from between her half-closed eyelids—eyelids that
            had never been fully closed in sleep the livelong night. The instant <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, cloaked and hooded, left the room, <character
                ref="Faith">Faith</character> sprang up, and prepared to go to her mother, whom she
            heard already stirring. Nearly every one in Salem was awake and up on this awful
            morning, though few were out of doors, as <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>
            passed along the streets. Here was the hastily erected gallows, the black shadow of
            which fell across the street with ghastly significance; now she had to pass the
            iron-barred gaol, through the unglazed windows of which she heard the fearful cry of a
            woman, and the sound of many footsteps. On she sped, sick almost to faintness, to the
            widow woman's where Mr. Nolan lodged. He was already up and abroad, gone, his hostess
            believed, to the gaol. Thither <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, repeating
            the words <quote>'for life and for death!'</quote> was forced to go. Retracing her
            steps, she was thankful to see him come out of those dismal portals, rendered more
            dismal for being in heavy shadow, just as she approached. What his errand had been she
            knew not; but he looked grave and sad, as she put <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character>'s letter into his hands, and stood before him quietly waiting,
            until he should read it, and deliver the expected answer. But, instead of opening it, he
            held it in his hand, apparently absorbed in thought. At last he spoke aloud, but more to
            himself than to her:</p>
        <p> 'My God! and is she then to die in this fearful delirium? It must be—can be—only
            delirium, that prompts such wild and horrible confessions. Mistress Barclay, I come from
            the presence of the Indian woman appointed to die. It seems, she considered herself
            betrayed last evening by her sentence not being respited, even after she had made
            confession of sin enough to bring down fire from heaven; and, it seems to me, the
            passionate, impotent anger of this helpless creature has turned to madness, for she
            appalls me by the additional revelations she has made to the keepers during the night—to
            me this morning. I could almost fancy that she thinks, by deepening the guilt she
            confesses, to escape this last dread punishment of all, as if, were a tithe of what she
            say true, one could suffer such a sinner to live. Yet to send her to death in such a
            state of mad terror! What is to be done?'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Yet Scripture says that we are not to suffer witches in the land,'</quote> said
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, slowly.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'True; I would but ask for a respite till the prayers of God'</quote>s people had
            gone up for His mercy. Some would pray for her, poor wretch as she is. You would,
            Mistress Barclay, I am sure?' But he said it in a questioning tone.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'I have been praying for her in the night many a time,'</quote> said <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, in a low voice. 'I pray for her in my heart at
            this moment; I suppose; they are bidden to put her out of the land, but I would not have
            her entirely God-forsaken. But, sir, you have not read my cousin<quote>'s letter. And
                she bade me bring back an answer with much urgency.'</quote></p>
        <p> Still he delayed. He was thinking of the dreadful confession he came from hearing. If it
            were true, the beautiful earth was a polluted place, and he almost wished to die, to
            escape from such pollution, into the white innocence of those who stood in the presence
            of God.</p>
        <p> Suddenly his eyes fell on <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>'s pure, grave
            face, upturned and watching his. <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> in earthly
            goodness came over his soul in that instant, <quote>'and he blessed her
                unaware.'</quote></p>
        <p> He put his hand on her shoulder, with an action half paternal—although the difference in
            their ages was not above a dozen years—and, bending a little towards her, whispered,
            half to himself, <quote>'Mistress Barclay, you have done me good.'</quote></p>
        <p>
            <quote>'I!'</quote> said <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, half
                affrighted—<quote>'I done you good! How?'</quote></p>
        <p> 'By being what you are. But, perhaps, I should rather thank God, who sent you at the
            very moment when my soul was so disquieted.'</p>
        <p> At this instant, they were aware of <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> standing in
            front of them, with a countenance of thunder. Her angry look made <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> feel guilty. She had not enough urged the pastor
            to read his letter, she thought; and it was indignation at this delay in what she had
            been commissioned to do with the urgency of life or death, that made her cousin lower at
            her so from beneath her straight black brows. <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> explained how she had not found Mr. Nolan at his lodgings, and had
            had to follow him to the door of the gaol. But <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>
            replied, with obdurate contempt:</p>
        <p> 'Spare thy breath, cousin <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>. It is easy
            seeing on what pleasant matters thou and the <character ref="Pastor Nolan">Pastor
                Nolan</character> were talking. I marvel not at thy forgetfulness. My mind is
            changed. Give me back my letter, sir; it was about a poor matter—an old woman's life.
            And what is that compared to a young girl<quote>'s love?'</quote></p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> heard but for an instant; did not
            understand that her cousin, in her jealous anger, could suspect the existence of such a
            feeling as love between her and Mr. Nolan. No imagination as to its possibility had ever
            entered her mind; she had respected him, almost revered him—nay, had liked him as the
            probable husband of <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>. At the thought that her
            cousin could believe her guilty of such treachery, her grave eyes dilated, and fixed
            themselves on the flaming countenance of <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>. That
            serious, unprotesting manner of perfect innocence must have told on her accuser, had it
            not been that, at the same instant, the latter caught sight of the crimsoned and
            disturbed countenance of the pastor, who felt the veil rent off the unconscious secret
            of his heart. <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> snatched her letter out of his
            hands, and said:</p>
        <p> 'Let the witch hang! What care I? She has done harm enough with her charms and her
            sorcery on <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character>'s girls. Let her
            die, and let all other witches look to themselves; for there be many kinds of witchcraft
            abroad. Cousin <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, thou wilt like best to
            stop with <character ref="Pastor Nolan">Pastor Nolan</character>, or I would pray thee
            to come back with me to breakfast.'</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was not to be daunted by jealous sarcasm.
            She held out her hand to <character ref="Pastor Nolan">Pastor Nolan</character>,
            determined to take no heed of her cousin's mad words, but to bid him farewell in her
            accustomed manner. He hesitated before taking it, and when he did, it was with a
            convulsive squeeze that almost made her start. <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>
            waited and watched all, with set lips and vengeful eyes. She bade no farewell; she spake
            no word; but grasping <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> tightly by the back
            of the arm, she almost drove her before her down the street till they reached their
            home.</p>
        <p> The arrangement for the morning was this: <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace
                Hickson</character> and her son <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> were
            to be present at the hanging of the first witch executed in Salem, as pious and godly
            heads of a family. All the other members were strictly forbidden to stir out, until such
            time as the low-tolling bell announced that all was over in this world for Hota, the
            Indian witch. When the execution was ended, there was to be a solemn prayer-meeting of
            all the inhabitants of Salem; ministers had come from a distance to aid by the efficacy
            of their prayers in these efforts to purge the land of the devil and his servants. There
            was reason to think that the great old meeting-house would be crowded, and when
                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> and <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> reached home, <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace
                Hickson</character> was giving her directions to <character ref="Prudence"
                >Prudence</character>, urging her to be ready for an early start to that place. The
            stern old woman was troubled in her mind at the anticipation of the sight she was to
            see, before many minutes were over, and spoke in a more hurried and incoherent manner
            than was her wont. She was dressed in her Sunday best; but her face was very grey and
            colourless, and she seemed afraid to cease speaking about household affairs, for fear
            she should have time to think. <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> stood by
            her, perfectly, rigidly still; he also was in his Sunday clothes. His face, too, was
            paler than its wont, but it wore a kind of absent, rapt expression, almost like that of
            a man who sees a vision. As <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> entered, still
            holding <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> in her fierce grasp, <character
                ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> started and smiled; but still dreamily. His
            manner was so peculiar, that even his mother stayed her talking to observe him more
            closely; he was in that state of excitement which usually ended in what his mother and
            certain of her friends esteemed a prophetic revelation. He began to speak, at first very
            low, and then his voice increased in power:</p>
        <p> 'How beautiful is the land of Beulah, far over the sea, beyond the mountains! Thither
            the angels carry her, lying back in their arms like one fainting. They shall kiss away
            the black circle of death, and lay her down at the feet of the Lamb. I hear her pleading
            there for those on earth who consented to her death. O <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>! pray also for me, pray for me, miserable!'</p>
        <p> When he uttered his cousin's name all their eyes turned towards her. It was to her that
            his vision related! She stood among them, amazed, awe-stricken, but not like one
            affrighted or dismayed. She was the first to speak:</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Dear friends, do not think of me; his words may or may not be true. I am in
                God'</quote>s hands all the same, whether he have the gift of prophecy or not.
            Besides, hear you not that I end where all would fain end? Think of him, and of his
            needs. Such times as these always leave him exhausted and weary, when he comes out of
            them.'</p>
        <p> And she busied herself in cares for his refreshment, aiding her aunt's trembling hands
            to set before him the requisite food, as he now sat tired and bewildered, gathering
            together with difficulty his scattered senses.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> did all she could to assist and speed
            their departure. But <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> stood apart, watching in
            silence with her passionate, angry eyes.</p>
        <p> As soon as they had set out on their solemn, fatal errand, <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character> left the room. She had not tasted food or touched drink. Indeed,
            they all felt sick at heart. The moment her sister had gone up stairs, <character
                ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> sprang to the settle on which <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> had thrown down her cloak and hood:</p>
        <p> 'Lend me your muffles and mantle, Cousin <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>.
            I never yet saw a woman hanged, and I see not why I should not go. I will stand on the
            edge of the crowd; no one will know me, and I will be home long before my mother.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'No!'</quote> said <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, 'that may not
            be. My aunt would be sore displeased. I wonder at you, <character ref="Prudence"
                >Prudence</character>, seeking to witness such a sight.' And as she spoke she held
            fast her cloak, which <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> vehemently
            struggled for.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> returned, brought back possibly by the sound of
            the struggle. She smiled—a deadly smile.</p>
        <p> 'Give it up, <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>. Strive no more with her.
            She has bought success in this world, and we are but her slaves.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Oh, <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>!'</quote> said <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, relinquishing her hold of the cloak, and
            turning round with passionate reproach in her look and voice, 'what have I done that you
            should speak so of me; you, that have loved as I think one love a sister?'</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> did not lose her opportunity, but hastily
            arrayed herself in the mantle, which was too large for her, and which she had,
            therefore, considered as well adapted for concealment; but, as she went towards the
            door, her feet became entangled in the unusual length, and she fell, bruising her arm
            pretty sharply.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Take care, another time, how you meddle with a witch'</quote>s things,' said
                <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>, as one scarcely believing her own words,
            but at enmity with all the world in her bitter jealousy of heart. <character
                ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> rubbed her arm and looked stealthily at
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Witch <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>! Witch <character
                    ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>!'</quote> said she at last, softly, pulling
            a childish face of spite at her.</p>
        <p> 'Oh, hush, <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>! Do not bandy such terrible
            words. Let me look at thine arm. I am sorry for thy hurt, only glad that it has kept
            thee from disobeying thy mother.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Away, away!'</quote> said <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>,
            springing from her. 'I am afeard of her in very truth, <character ref="Faith"
                >Faith</character>. Keep between me and the witch, or I will throw a stool at
            her.'</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> smiled—it was a bad and wicked smile—but she
            did not stir to calm the fears she had called up in her young sister. Just at this
            moment, the bell began to toll. Hota, the Indian witch, was dead. <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> covered her face with her hands. Even <character
                ref="Faith">Faith</character> went a deadlier pale than she had been, and said,
            sighing, <quote>'Poor Hota! But death is best.'</quote></p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> alone seemed unmoved by any thoughts
            connected with the solemn, monotonous sound. Her only consideration was, that now she
            might go out into the street and see the sights, and hear the news, and escape from the
            terror which she felt at the presence of her cousin. She flew up stairs to find her own
            mantle, ran down again, and past <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, before
            the English girl had finished her prayer, and was speedily mingled among the crowd going
            to the meetinghouse. There also <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> and <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> came in due course of time, but separately, not
            together. <character ref="Faith">Faith</character> so evidently avoided <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, that she, humbled and grieved, could not force
            her company upon her cousin, but loitered a little behind,—the quiet tears stealing down
            her face, shed for the many causes that had occurred this morning.</p>
        <p> The meeting-house was full to suffocation; and, as it sometimes happens on such
            occasions, the greatest crowd was close about the doors, from the fact that few saw, on
            their first entrance, where there might be possible spaces into which they could wedge
            themselves. Yet they were impatient of any arrivals from the outside, and pushed and
            hustled <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>, and after her <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, till the two were forced on to a conspicuous
            place in the very centre of the building, where there was no chance of a seat, but still
            space to stand in. Several stood around, the pulpit being in the middle, and already
            occupied by two ministers in Geneva bands and gowns, while other ministers, similarly
            attired, stood holding on to it, almost as if they were giving support instead of
            receiving it. Grace Hickson and her son sat decorously in their own pew, thereby showing
            that they had arrived early from the execution. You might almost have traced out the
            number of those who had been at the hanging of the Indian witch, by the expression of
            their countenances. They were awestricken into terrible repose; while the crowd pouring
            in, still pouring in, of those who had not attended the execution, looked all restless,
            and excited, and fierce. A buzz went round the meeting, that the stranger minister who
            stood along with <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character> in the pulpit
            was no other than Dr. Cotton Mather himself, come all the way from Boston to assist in
            purging Salem of witches.</p>
        <p> And now <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character> began his prayer,
            extempore, as was the custom. His words were wild and incoherent, as might be expected
            from a man who had just been consenting to the bloody death of one who was, but a few
            days ago, a member of his own family; violent and passionate, as was to be looked for in
            the father of children, whom he believed to suffer so fearfully from the crime he would
            denounce before the Lord. He sat down at length from pure exhaustion. Then Dr. Cotton
            Mather stood forward: he did not utter more than a few words of prayer, calm in
            comparison with what had gone before, and then he went on to address the great crowd
            before him in a quiet, argumentative way, but arranging what he had to say with
            something of the same kind of skill which Antony used in his speech to the Romans after
                Cæsar<quote>'s murder. Some of Dr. Mather'</quote>s words have been preserved to us,
            as he afterwards wrote them down in one of his works. Speaking of those
                <quote>'unbelieving Sadducees'</quote> who doubted the existence of such a crime, he
            said: 'Instead of their apish shouts and jeers at blessed Scripture, and histories which
            have such undoubted confirmation as that no man that has breeding enough to regard the
            common laws of human society will offer to doubt of them, it becomes us rather to adore
            the goodness of God, who from the mouths of babes and sucklings has ordained truth, and
            by the means of the sore-afflicted children of your godly pastor, has revealed the fact
            that the devils have with most horrid operations broken in upon your neighbourhood. Let
            us beseech Him that their power may be restrained, and that they go not so far in their
            evil machinations as they did but four years ago in the city of Boston, where I was the
            humble means, under God, of loosing from the power of Satan the four children of that
            religious and blessed man, Mr. Goodwin. These four babes of grace were bewitched by an
            Irish witch; there is no end to the narration of the torments they had to submit to. At
            one time they would bark like dogs, at another purr like cats; yea, they would fly like
            geese, and be carried with an incredible swiftness, having but just their toes now and
            then upon the ground, sometimes not once in twenty feet, and their arms waved like those
            of a bird. Yet at other times, by the hellish devices of the woman who had bewitched
            them, they could not stir without limping, for, by means of an invisible chain, she
            hampered their limbs, or, sometimes, by means of a noose, almost choked them. One in
            especial was subjected by this woman of Satan to such heat as of an oven, that I myself
            have seen the sweat drop from off her, while all around were moderately cold and well at
            ease. But not to trouble you with more of my stories, I will go on to prove that it was
            Satan himself that held power over her. For a very remarkable thing it was, that she was
            not permitted by that evil spirit to read any godly or religious book, speaking the
            truth as it is in Jesus. She could read Popish books well enough, while both sight and
            speech seemed to fail her when I gave her the Assembly's Catechism. Again, she was fond
            of that prelatical Book of Common Prayer, which is but the Roman mass-book in an English
            and ungodly shape. In the midst of her sufferings, if one put the Prayer-book into her
            hands it relieved her. Yet mark you, she could never be brought to read the Lord's
            Prayer, whatever book she met with it in, proving thereby distinctly that she was in
            league with the devil. I took her into my own house, that I, even as Dr. Martin Luther
            did, might wrestle with the devil and have my fling at him. But when I called my
            household to prayer, the devils that possessed her caused her to whistle, and sing, and
            yell in a discordant and hellish fashion.'</p>
        <p> At this very instant, a shrill, clear whistle pierced all ears. Dr. Mather stopped for a
            moment:</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Satan is among you!'</quote> he cried. <quote>'Look to yourselves!'</quote> And
            he prayed with fervour, as if against a present and threatening enemy; but no one heeded
            him. Whence came that ominous, unearthly whistle? Every man watched his neighbour. Again
            the whistle, out of their very midst! And then a bustle in a corner of the building,
            three or four people stirring, without any cause immediately perceptible to those at a
            distance, the movement spread, and, directly after, a passage even in that dense mass of
            people was cleared for two men, who bore forwards <character ref="Prudence"
                >Prudence</character> Hickson, lying rigid as a log of wood, in the convulsive
            position of one who suffered from an epileptic fit. They laid her down among the
            ministers who were gathered round the pulpit. Her mother came to her, sending up a
            wailing cry at the sight of her distorted child. Dr. Mather came down from the pulpit
            and stood over her, exorcising the devil in possession, as one accustomed to such
            scenes. The crowd pressed forward in mute horror. At length, her rigidity of form and
            feature gave way, and she was terribly convulsed—torn by the devil, as they called it.
            By-and-by the violence of the attack was over, and the spectators began to breathe once
            more, though still the former horror brooded over them, and they listened as if for the
            sudden ominous whistle again, and glanced fearfully around, as if Satan were at their
            backs picking out his next victim.</p>
        <p> Meanwhile, Dr. Mather, <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character>, and one
            or two others were exhorting <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> to reveal,
            if she could, the name of the person, the witch, who, by influence over Satan, had
            subjected the child to such torture as that which they had just witnessed. They bade her
            speak in the name of the Lord. She whispered a name in the low voice of exhaustion. None
            of the congregation could hear what it was. But the <character ref="Pastor Tappau"
                >Pastor Tappau</character>, when he heard it, drew back in dismay, while Dr. Mather,
            knowing not to whom the name belonged, cried out, in a clear, cold voice,</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Know ye one <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> Barclay; for it is
                she who hath bewitched this poor child?'</quote></p>
        <p> The answer was given rather by action than by word, although a low murmur went up from
            many. But all fell back, as far as falling back in such a crowd was possible, from
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> Barclay, where she stood,—and looked
            on her with surprise and horror. A space of some feet, where no possibility of space had
            seemed to be not a minute before, left <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>
            standing alone, with every eye fixed upon her in hatred and dread. She stood like one
            speechless, tongue-tied, as if in a dream. She a witch! accursed as witches were in the
            sight of God and man! Her smooth, healthy face became contracted into shrivel and
            pallor, but she uttered not a word, only looked at Dr. Mather with her dilated,
            terrified eyes.</p>
        <p> Some one said, <quote>'She is of the household of <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace
                    Hickson</character>, a God-fearing woman.'</quote>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> did not know if the words were in her
            favour or not. She did not think about them, even; they told less on her than on any
            person present. She a witch! and the silver glittering Avon, and the drowning woman she
            had seen in her childhood at Barford,—at home in England,—were before her, and her eyes
            fell before her doom. There was some commotion—some rustling of papers; the magistrates
            of the town were drawing near the pulpit and consulting with the ministers. Dr. Mather
            spoke again:</p>
        <p> 'The Indian woman, who was hung this morning, named certain people, whom she deposed to
            having seen at the horrible meetings for the worship of Satan; but there is no name of
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> Barclay down upon the paper, although
            we are stricken at the sight of the names of some——'</p>
        <p> An interruption—a consultation. Again Dr. Mather spoke:</p>
        <p> 'Bring the accused witch, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> Barclay, near
            to this poor suffering child of Christ.'</p>
        <p> They rushed forward to force <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> to the place
            where <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> lay. But <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> walked forward of herself.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'<character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>,'</quote> she said, in such a
            sweet, touching voice, that, long afterwards, those who heard it that day, spoke of it
            to their children, 'have I ever said an unkind word to you, much less done you an ill
            turn? Speak, dear child. You did not know what you said just now, did you?'</p>
        <p> But <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> writhed away from her approach, and
            screamed out, as if stricken with fresh agony.</p>
        <p> 'Take her away! take her away! Witch <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,
            witch <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, who threw me down only this
            morning, and turned my arm black and blue.' And she bared her arm, as if in confirmation
            of her words. It was sorely bruised.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'I was not near you, <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>!'</quote>
            said <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, sadly. But that was only reckoned
            fresh evidence of her diabolical power.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>'s brain began to get bewildered. Witch
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>! she a witch, abhorred of all men!
            Yet she would try to think, and make one more effort.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Aunt Hickson,'</quote> she said, and Grace came forwards—<quote>'am I a witch,
                Aunt Hickson?'</quote> she asked; for her aunt, stern, harsh, unloving as she might
            be, was truth itself, and <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> thought—so near
            to delirium had she come—if her aunt condemned her, it was possible she might indeed be
            a witch.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character> faced her unwillingly.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'It is a stain upon our family for ever,'</quote> was the thought in her
            mind.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'It is for God to judge whether thou art a witch, or not. Not for
            me.'</quote></p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Alas, alas!'</quote> moaned <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>; for
            she had looked at <character ref="Faith">Faith</character>, and learnt that no good word
            was to be expected from her gloomy face and averted eyes. The meeting-house was full of
            eager voices, repressed, out of reverence for the place, into tones of earnest murmuring
            that seemed to fill the air with gathering sounds of anger, and those who had at first
            fallen back from the place where <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> stood
            were now pressing forwards and round about her, ready to seize the young friendless
            girl, and bear her off to prison. Those who might have been, who ought to have been, her
            friends, were either averse or indifferent to her; though only <character ref="Prudence"
                >Prudence</character> made any open outcry upon her. That evil child cried out
            perpetually that <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> had cast a devilish
            spell upon her, and bade them keep the witch away from her; and, indeed, <character
                ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> was strangely convulsed when once or twice
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>'s perplexed and wistful eyes were
            turned in her direction. Here and there girls, women uttering strange cries, and
            apparently suffering from the same kind of convulsive fit as that which had attacked
                <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>, were centres of a group of agitated
            friends, who muttered much and savagely of witchcraft, and the list which had been taken
            down only the night before from Hota's own lips. They demanded to have it made public,
            and objected to the slow forms of the law. Others, not so much or so immediately
            interested in the sufferers, were kneeling around, and praying aloud for themselves and
            their own safety, until the excitement should be so much quelled as to enable Dr. Cotton
            Mather to be again heard in prayer and exhortation.</p>
        <p> And where was <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>? What said he? You must
            remember, that the stir of the outcry, the accusation, the appeals of the accused, all
            seemed to go on at once amid the buzz and din of the people who had come to worship God,
            but remained to judge and upbraid their fellow-creature. Till now <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> had only caught a glimpse of <character
                ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>, who was apparently trying to push forwards, but
            whom his mother was holding back with word and action, as <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> knew she would hold him back; for it was not for the first time
            that she was made aware how carefully her aunt had always shrouded his decent reputation
            among his fellow-citizens from the least suspicion of his seasons of excitement and
            incipient insanity. On such days, when he himself imagined that he heard prophetic
            voices, and saw prophetic visions, his mother would do much to prevent any besides his
            own family from seeing him; and now <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, by a
            process swifter than reasoning, felt certain, from her one look at his face, when she
            saw it, colourless and deformed by intensity of expression, among a number of others all
            simply ruddy and angry, that he was in such a state that his mother would in vain do her
            utmost to prevent his making himself conspicuous. Whatever force or argument Grace used,
            it was of no avail. In another moment he was by <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>'s side, stammering with excitement, and giving vague testimony,
            which would have been of little value in a calm court of justice, and was only oil to
            the smouldering fire of that audience.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Away with her to gaol!'</quote>
            <quote>'Seek out the witches!'</quote> 'The sin has spread into all households!<quote>'
                '</quote>Satan is in the very midst of us!<quote>' '</quote>Strike and spare not!'
            In vain Dr. Cotton Mather raised his voice in loud prayers, in which he assumed the
            guilt of the accused girl; no one listened, all were anxious to secure <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, as if they feared she would vanish from before
            their very eyes; she, white, trembling, standing quite still in the tight grasp of
            strange, fierce men, her dilated eyes only wandering a little now and then in search of
            some pitiful face—some pitiful face that among all those hundreds was not to be found.
            While some fetched cords to bind her, and others, by low questions, suggested new
            accusations to the distempered brain of <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>,
                <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> obtained a hearing once more.
            Addressing Dr. Cotton Mather, he said, evidently anxious to make clear some new argument
            that had just suggested itself to him: 'Sir, in this matter, be she witch or not, the
            end has been foreshown to me by the spirit of prophecy. Now, reverend sir, if the event
            be known to the spirit, it must have been foredoomed in the councils of God. If so, why
            punish her for doing that in which she had no free will?'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Young man,'</quote> said Dr. Mather, bending down from the pulpit and looking
            very severely upon <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>, <quote>'take care!
                you are trenching on blasphemy.'</quote></p>
        <p> 'I do not care. I say it again. Either <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>
            Barclay is a witch, or she is not. If she is, it has been foredoomed for her, for I have
            seen a vision of her death as a condemned witch for many months past—and the voice has
            told me there was but one escape for her, <character ref="Lois Barclay"
            >Lois</character>—the voice you know—' In his excitement he began to wander a little,
            but it was touching to see how conscious he was that by giving way he would lose the
            thread of the logical argument by which he hoped to prove that <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> ought not to be punished, and with what an
            effort he wrenched his imagination away from the old ideas, and strove to concentrate
            all his mind upon the plea that, if <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was a
            witch, it had been shown him by prophecy; and if there was prophecy there must be
            foreknowledge; if foreknowledge, foredoom; if foredoom, no exercise of free will, and,
            therefore, that <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was not justly amenable
            to punishment.</p>
        <p> On he went, plunging into heresy, caring not—growing more and more passionate every
            instant, but directing his passion into keen argument, desperate sarcasm, instead of
            allowing it to excite his imagination. Even Dr. Mather felt himself on the point of
            being worsted in the very presence of this congregation, who, but a short half-hour ago,
            looked upon him as all but infallible. Keep a good heart, Cotton Mather! your opponent's
            eye begins to glare and flicker with a terrible yet uncertain light—his speech grows
            less coherent, and his arguments are mixed up with wild glimpses at wilder revelations
            made to himself alone. He has touched on the limits,—he has entered the borders of
            blasphemy, and with an awful cry of horror and reprobation the congregation rise up, as
            one man, against the blasphemer. Dr. Mather smiled a grim smile, and the people were
            ready to stone <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>, who went on, regardless,
            talking and raving.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Stay, stay!'</quote> said <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace
                Hickson</character>—all the decent family shame which prompted her to conceal the
            mysterious misfortune of her only son from public knowledge done away with by the sense
            of the immediate danger to his life. 'Touch him not. He knows not what he is saying. The
            fit is upon him. I tell you the truth before God. My son, my only son, is mad.'</p>
        <p> They stood aghast at the intelligence. The grave young citizen, who had silently taken
            his part in life close by them in their daily lives—not mixing much with them, it was
            true, but looked up to, perhaps, all the more—the student of abstruse books on theology,
            fit to converse with the most learned ministers that ever came about those parts—was he
            the same with the man now pouring out wild words to <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> the witch, as if he and she were the only two present! A solution
            of it all occurred to them. He was another victim. Great was the power of Satan! Through
            the arts of the devil, that white statue of a girl had mastered the soul of <character
                ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> Hickson. So the word spread from mouth to mouth.
            And Grace heard it. It seemed a healing balsam for her shame. With wilful, dishonest
            blindness, she would not see—not even in her secret heart would she acknowledge, that
                <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> had been strange, and moody, and
            violent long before the English girl had reached Salem. She even found some specious
            reason for his attempt at suicide long ago. He was recovering from a fever—and though
            tolerably well in health, the delirium had not finally left him. But since <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> came, how headstrong he had been at times! how
            unreasonable! how moody! What a strange delusion was that which he was under, of being
            bidden by some voice to marry her! How he followed her about, and clung to her, as under
            some compulsion of affection! And over all reigned the idea that, if he were indeed
            suffering from being bewitched, he was not mad, and might again assume the honourable
            position he had held in the congregation and in the town, when the spell by which he was
            held was destroyed. So Grace yielded to the notion herself, and encouraged it in others,
            that <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> Barclay had bewitched both
                <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> and <character ref="Prudence"
                >Prudence</character>. And the consequence of this belief was, that <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was to be tried, with little chance in her
            favour, to see whether she was a witch or no; and if a witch, whether she would confess,
            implicate others, repent, and live a life of bitter shame, avoided by all men, and
            cruelly treated by most; or die impenitent, hardened, denying her crime upon the
            gallows.</p>
        <p> And so they dragged <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> away from the
            congregation of Christians to the gaol, to await her trial. I say <quote>'dragged
                her,'</quote> because, although she was docile enough to have followed them whither
            they would, she was now so faint as to require extraneous force—poor <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>! who should have been carried and tended
            lovingly in her state of exhaustion, but, instead, was so detested by the multitude, who
            looked upon her as an accomplice of Satan in all his evil doings, that they cared no
            more how they treated her than a careless boy minds how he handles the toad that he is
            going to throw over the wall.</p>
        <p> When <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> came to her full senses, she found
            herself lying on a short hard bed in a dark square room, which she at once knew must be
            a part of the city gaol. It was about eight feet square, it had stone walls on every
            side, and a grated opening high above her head, letting in all the light and air that
            could enter through about a square foot of aperture. It was so lonely, so dark to that
            poor girl, when she came slowly and painfully out of her long faint. She did so want
            human help in that struggle which always supervenes after a swoon; when the effort is to
            clutch at life, and the effort seems too much for the will. She did not at first
            understand where she was; did not understand how she came to be there, nor did she care
            to understand. Her physical instinct was to lie still and let the hurrying pulses have
            time to calm. So she shut her eyes once more. Slowly, slowly the recollection of the
            scene in the meeting-house shaped itself into a kind of picture before her. She saw
            within her eyelids, as it were, that sea of loathing faces all turned towards her, as
            towards something unclean and hateful. And you must remember, you who in the nineteenth
            century read this account, that witchcraft was a real terrible sin to her, <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> Barclay, two hundred years ago. The look on
            their faces, stamped on heart and brain, excited in her a sort of strange sympathy.
            Could it, oh God!—could it be true, that Satan had obtained the terrific power over her
            and her will, of which she had heard and read? Could she indeed be possessed by a demon
            and be indeed a witch, and yet till now have been unconscious of it? And her excited
            imagination recalled, with singular vividness, all she had ever heard on the subject—the
            horrible midnight sacrament, the very presence and power of Satan. Then remembering
            every angry thought against her neighbour, against the impertinences of <character
                ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>, against the overbearing authority of her aunt,
            against the persevering crazy suit of <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>,
            the indignation—only that morning, but such ages off in real time—at <character
                ref="Faith">Faith</character>'s injustice; oh, could such evil thoughts have had
            devilish power given to them by the father of evil, and, all unconsciously to herself,
            have gone forth as active curses into the world? And so, on the ideas went careering
            wildly through the poor girl's brain—the girl thrown inward upon herself. At length, the
            sting of her imagination forced her to start up impatiently. What was this? A weight of
            iron on her legs—a weight stated afterwards, by the gaoler of Salem prison, to have been
                <quote>'not more than eight pounds.'</quote> It was well for <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> it was a tangible ill, bringing her back from
            the wild illimitable desert in which her imagination was wandering. She took hold of the
            iron, and saw her torn stocking,—her bruised ankle, and began to cry pitifully, out of
            strange compassion with herself. They feared, then, that even in that cell she would
            find a way to escape. Why, the utter, ridiculous impossibility of the thing convinced
            her of her own innocence, and ignorance of all supernatural power; and the heavy iron
            brought her strangely round from the delusions that seemed to be gathering about
            her.</p>
        <p> No! she never could fly out of that deep dungeon; there was no escape, natural or
            supernatural, for her, unless by man<quote>'s mercy. And what was man'</quote>s mercy in
            such times of panic? <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> knew that it was
            nothing; instinct more than reason taught her, that panic calls out cowardice, and
            cowardice cruelty. Yet she cried, cried freely, and for the first time, when she found
            herself ironed and chained. It seemed so cruel, so much as if her fellow-creatures had
            really learnt to hate and dread her—her, who had had a few angry thoughts, which God
            forgive! but whose thoughts had never gone into words, far less into actions. Why, even
            now she could love all the household at home, if they would but let her; yes, even yet,
            though she felt that it was the open accusation of <character ref="Prudence"
                >Prudence</character> and the withheld justifications of her aunt and <character
                ref="Faith">Faith</character> that had brought her to her present strait. Would they
            ever come and see her? Would kinder thoughts of her,—who had shared their daily bread
            for months and months,—bring them to see her, and ask her whether it were really she who
            had brought on the illness of <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>, the
            derangement of <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>'s mind?</p>
        <p> No one came. Bread and water were pushed in by some one, who hastily locked and unlocked
            the door, and cared not to see if he put them within his prisoner's reach, or perhaps
            thought that physical fact mattered little to a witch. It was long before <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> could reach them; and she had something of the
            natural hunger of youth left in her still, which prompted her, lying her length on the
            floor, to weary herself with efforts to obtain the bread. After she had eaten some of
            it, the day began to wane, and she thought she would lay her down and try to sleep. But
            before she did so, the gaoler heard her singing the Evening Hymn:</p>
        <p> Glory to thee, my God, this night, For all the blessings of the light.</p>
        <p> And a dull thought came into his dull mind, that she was thankful for few blessings, if
            she could tune up her voice to sing praises after this day of what, if she were a witch,
            was shameful detection in abominable practices, and if not—. Well, his mind stopped
            short at this point in his wondering contemplation. <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> knelt down and said the Lord's Prayer, pausing just a little
            before one clause, that she might be sure that in her heart of hearts she did forgive.
            Then she looked at her ankle, and the tears came into her eyes once again, but not so
            much because she was hurt, as because men must have hated her so bitterly before they
            could have treated her thus. Then she lay down, and fell asleep.</p>
        <p> The next day, she was led before Mr. Hathorn and Mr. Curwin, justices of Salem, to be
            accused legally and publicly of witchcraft. Others were with her, under the same charge.
            And when the prisoners were brought in, they were cried out at by the abhorrent crowd.
            The two Tappaus, <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>, and one or two other
            girls of the same age were there, in the character of victims of the spells of the
            accused. The prisoners were placed about seven or eight feet from the justices and the
            accusers between the justices and them; the former were then ordered to stand right
            before the justices. All this <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> did at
            their bidding, with something of the wondering docility of a child, but not with any
            hope of softening the hard, stony look of detestation that was on all the countenances
            around her, save those that were distorted by more passionate anger. Then an officer was
            bidden to hold each of her hands, and Justice Hathorn bade her keep her eyes continually
            fixed on him, for this reason—which, however, was not told to her—lest, if she looked on
                <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>, the girl might either fall into a
            fit, or cry out that she was suddenly and violently hurt. If any heart could have been
            touched of that cruel multitude, they would have felt some compassion for the sweet
            young face of the English girl, trying so meekly to do all that she was ordered, her
            face quite white, yet so full of sad gentleness, her grey eyes, a little dilated by the
            very solemnity of her position, fixed with the intent look of innocent maidenhood on the
            stern face of Justice Hathorn. And thus they stood in silence, one breathless minute.
            Then they were bidden to say the Lord's Prayer. <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> went through it as if alone in her cell; but, as she had done
            alone in her cell the night before, she made a little pause, before the prayer to be
            forgiven as she forgave. And at this instant of hesitation—as if they had been on the
            watch for it—they all cried out upon her for a witch, and when the clamour ended the
            justices bade <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> Hickson come forwards. Then
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> turned a little to one side, wishing
            to see at least one familiar face; but when her eyes fell upon <character ref="Prudence"
                >Prudence</character>, the girl stood stock-still, and answered no questions, nor
            spoke a word, and the justices declared that she was struck dumb by witchcraft. Then
            some behind took <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> under the arms, and
            would have forced her forwards to touch <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>,
            possibly esteeming that as a cure for her being bewitched. But <character ref="Prudence"
                >Prudence</character> had hardly been made to take three steps before she struggled
            out of their arms, and fell down writhing as in a fit, calling out with shrieks, and
            entreating <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> to help her, and save her from
            her torment. Then all the girls began 'to tumble down like swine' (to use the words of
            an eye-witness) and to cry out upon <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> and
            her fellow-prisoners. These last were now ordered to stand with their hands stretched
            out, it being imagined that if the bodies of the witches were arranged in the form of a
            cross they would lose their evil power. By-and-by <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> felt her strength going, from the unwonted fatigue of such a
            position, which she had borne patiently until the pain and weariness had forced both
            tears and sweat down her face, and she asked in a low, plaintive voice, if she might not
            rest her head for a few moments against the wooden partition. But Justice Hathorn told
            her she had strength enough to torment others, and should have strength enough to stand.
            She sighed a little, and bore on, the clamour against her and the other accused
            increasing every moment; the only way she could keep herself from utterly losing
            consciousness was by distracting herself from present pain and danger, and saying to
            herself verses of the Psalms as she could remember them, expressive of trust in God. At
            length she was ordered back to gaol, and dimly understood that she and others were
            sentenced to be hanged for witchcraft. Many people now looked eagerly at <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, to see if she would weep at this doom. If she
            had had strength to cry, it might—it was just possible that it might—have been
            considered a plea in her favour, for witches could not shed tears, but she was too
            exhausted and dead. All she wanted was to lie down once more on her prison-bed, out of
            the reach of men's cries of abhorrence, and out of shot of their cruel eyes. So they led
            her back to prison, speechless and tearless.</p>
        <p> But rest gave her back her power of thought and suffering. Was it, indeed, true that she
            was to die? She, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> Barclay, only eighteen,
            so well, so young, so full of love and hope as she had been, till but these little days
            past! What would they think of it at home—real, dear home at Barford, in England? There
            they had loved her; there she had gone about, singing and rejoicing all the day long in
            the pleasant meadows by the Avon side. Oh, why did father and mother die, and leave her
            their bidding to come here to this cruel New England shore, where no one had wanted her,
            no one had cared for her, and where now they were going to put her to a shameful death
            as a witch? And there would be no one to send kindly messages by to those she should
            never see more. Never more! Young Lucy was living, and joyful—probably thinking of her,
            and of his declared intention of coming to fetch her home to be his wife this very
            spring. Possibly he had forgotten her; no one knew. A week before, she would have been
            indignant at her own distrust in thinking for a minute that he could forget. Now, she
            doubted all men's goodness for a time; for those around her were deadly, and cruel, and
            relentless.</p>
        <p> Then she turned round, and beat herself with angry blows (to speak in images), for ever
            doubting her lover. Oh! if she were but with him! Oh! if she might but be with him! He
            would not let her die; but would hide her in his bosom from the wrath of this people,
            and carry her back to the old home at Barford. And he might even now be sailing on the
            wide blue sea, coming nearer, nearer every moment, and yet be too late after all.</p>
        <p> So the thoughts chased each other through her head all that feverish night, till she
            clung almost deliriously to life, and wildly prayed that she might not die; at least,
            not just yet, and she so young!</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character> and certain elders roused her
            up from a heavy sleep, late on the morning of the following day. All night long she had
            trembled and cried, till morning had come peering in through the square grating up
            above. It soothed her, and she fell asleep, to be awakened, as I have said, by
                <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character>.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Arise!'</quote> said he, scrupling to touch her, from his superstitious idea of
            her evil powers. <quote>'It is noonday.'</quote></p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Where am I?'</quote> said she, bewildered at this unusual wakening, and the
            array of severe faces all gazing upon her with reprobation.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'You are in Salem gaol, condemned for a witch.'</quote></p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Alas! I had forgotten for an instant,'</quote> said she, dropping her head upon
            her breast.</p>
        <p> 'She has been out on a devilish ride all night long, doubtless, and is weary and
            perplexed this morning,' whispered one, in so low a voice that he did not think she
            could hear; but she lifted up her eyes, and looked at him, with mute reproach.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'We are come'</quote> said <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor
                Tappau</character>, 'to exhort you to confess your great and manifold sin.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'My great and manifold sin!'</quote> repeated <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> to herself, shaking her head.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Yea, your sin of witchcraft. If you will confess, there may yet be balm in
                Gilead.'</quote></p>
        <p> One of the elders, struck with pity at the young girl's wan, shrunken look, said, that
            if she confessed, and repented, and did penance, possibly her life might yet be
            spared.</p>
        <p> A sudden flash of light came into her sunk, dulled eye. Might she yet live? Was it yet
            in her power?</p>
        <p> Why, no one knew how soon Ralph Lucy might be here, to take her away for ever into the
            peace of a new home! Life! Oh, then, all hope was not over—perhaps she might still live,
            and not die. Yet the truth came once more out of her lips, almost without any exercise
            of her will.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'I am not a witch,'</quote> she said.</p>
        <p> Then <character ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character> blindfolded her, all
            unresisting, but with languid wonder in her heart as to what was to come next. She heard
            people enter the dungeon softly, and heard whispering voices; then her hands were lifted
            up and made to touch some one near, and in an instant she heard a noise of struggling,
            and the well-known voice of <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> shrieking out
            in one of her hysterical fits, and screaming to be taken away and out of that place. It
            seemed to <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> as if some of her judges must
            have doubted of her guilt, and demanded yet another test. She sat down heavily on her
            bed, thinking she must be in a horrible dream, so compassed about with dangers and
            enemies did she seem. Those in the dungeon—and by the oppression of the air she
            perceived that they were many—kept on eager talking in low voices. She did not try to
            make out the sense of the fragments of sentences that reached her dulled brain, till,
            all at once, a word or two made her understand they were discussing the desirableness of
            applying the whip or the torture to make her confess, and reveal by what means the spell
            she had cast upon those whom she had bewitched could be dissolved. A thrill of affright
            ran through her; and she cried out, beseechingly:</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'I beg you, sirs, for God'</quote>s mercy sake, that you do not use such awful
            means. I may say anything—nay, I may accuse any one if I am subjected to such torment as
            I have heard tell about. For I am but a young girl, and not very brave, or very good, as
            some are.'</p>
        <p> It touched the hearts of one or two to see her standing there; the tears streaming down
            from below the coarse handkerchief tightly bound over her eyes; the clanking chain
            fastening the heavy weight to the slight ankle; the two hands held together as if to
            keep down a convulsive motion.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Look!'</quote> said one of these. <quote>'She is weeping. They say no witch can
                weep tears.'</quote></p>
        <p> But another scoffed at this test, and bade the first remember how those of her own
            family, the Hicksons even, bore witness against her.</p>
        <p> Once more she was bidden to confess. The charges, esteemed by all men (as they said) to
            have been proven against her, were read over to her, with all the testimony borne
            against her in proof thereof. They told her that, considering the godly family to which
            she belonged, it had been decided by the magistrates and ministers of Salem that he
            should have her life spared, if she would own her guilt, make reparation, and submit to
            penance; but that if not, she, and others convicted of witchcraft along with her, were
            to be hung in Salem market-place on the next Thursday morning (Thursday being market
            day). And when they had thus spoken, they waited silently for her answer. It was a
            minute or two before she spoke. She had sat down again upon the bed meanwhile, for
            indeed she was very weak. She asked, 'May I have this handkerchief unbound from my eyes,
            for indeed, sirs, it hurts me?'</p>
        <p> The occasion for which she was blindfolded being over, the bandage was taken off, and
            she was allowed to see. She looked pitifully at the stern faces around her, in grim
            suspense as to what her answer would be. Then she spoke:</p>
        <p> 'Sirs, I must choose death with a quiet conscience, rather than life to be gained by a
            lie. I am not a witch. I know not hardly what you mean when you say I am. I have done
            many, many things very wrong in my life; but I think God will forgive me them for my
                Saviour<quote>'s sake.'</quote></p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Take not His name on your wicked lips,'</quote> said <character
                ref="Pastor Tappau">Pastor Tappau</character>, enraged at her resolution of not
            confessing, and scarcely able to keep himself from striking her. She saw the desire he
            had, and shrank away in timid fear. Then Justice Hathorn solemnly read the legal
            condemnation of <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> Barclay to death by
            hanging, as a convicted witch. She murmured something which nobody heard fully, but
            which sounded like a prayer for pity and compassion on her tender years and friendless
            estate. Then they left her to all the horrors of that solitary, loathsome dungeon, and
            the strange terror of approaching death.</p>
        <p> Outside the prison walls, the dread of the witches, and the excitement against
            witchcraft, grew with fearful rapidity. Numbers of women, and men, too, were accused, no
            matter what their station of life and their former character had been. On the other
            side, it is alleged that upwards of fifty persons were grievously vexed by the devil,
            and those to whom he had imparted of his power for vile and wicked considerations. How
            much of malice, distinct, unmistakable personal malice, was mixed up with these
            accusations, no one can now tell. The dire statistics of this time tell us, that
            fifty-five escaped death by confessing themselves guilty, one hundred and fifty were in
            prison, more than two hundred accused, and upwards of twenty suffered death, among whom
            was the minister I have called Nolan, who was traditionally esteemed to have suffered
            through hatred of his co-pastor. One old man, scorning the accusation, and refusing to
            plead at his trial, was, according to the law, pressed to death for his contumacy. Nay,
            even dogs were accused of witchcraft, suffered the legal penalties, and are recorded
            among the subjects of capital punishment. One young man found means to effect his
            mother's escape from confinement, fled with her on horseback, and secreted her in the
            Blueberry Swamp, not far from Taplay's Brook, in the Great Pasture; he concealed her
            here in a wigwam which he built for her shelter, provided her with food and clothing,
            and comforted and sustained her until after the delusion had passed away. The poor
            creature must, however, have suffered dreadfully, for one of her arms was fractured in
            the all but desperate effort of getting her out of prison.</p>
        <p> But there was no one to try and save <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>.
                <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character> would fain have ignored her
            altogether. Such a taint did witchcraft bring upon a whole family, that generations of
            blameless life were not at that day esteemed sufficient to wash it out. Besides, you
            must remember that Grace, along with most people of her time, believed most firmly in
            the reality of the crime of witchcraft. Poor, forsaken <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>, believed in it herself, and it added to her terror, for the
            gaoler, in an unusually communicative mood, told her that nearly every cell was now full
            of witches; and it was possible he might have to put one, if more came, in with her.
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> knew that she was no witch herself;
            but not the less did she believe that the crime was abroad, and largely shared in by
            evil-minded persons who had chosen to give up their souls to Satan; and she shuddered
            with terror at what the gaoler said, and would have asked him to spare her this
            companionship if it were possible. But, somehow, her senses were leaving her, and she
            could not remember the right words in which to form her request, until he had left the
            place.</p>
        <p> The only person who yearned after <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>—who
            would have befriended her if he could—was <character ref="Manasseh"
            >Manasseh</character>: poor, mad <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>. But he
            was so wild and outrageous in his talk, that it was all his mother could do to keep his
            state concealed from public observation. She had for this purpose given him a sleeping
            potion; and, while he lay heavy and inert under the influence of the poppy-tea, his
            mother bound him with cords to the ponderous, antique bed in which he slept. She looked
            broken-hearted while she did this office, and thus acknowledged the degradation of her
            first-born—him of whom she had ever been so proud.</p>
        <p> Late that evening, <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character> stood in
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>'s cell, hooded and cloaked up to her
            eyes. <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was sitting quite still, playing
            idly with a bit of string which one of the magistrates had dropped out of his pocket
            that morning. Her aunt was standing by her for an instant or two in silence, before
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> seemed aware of her presence.
            Suddenly she looked up, and uttered a little cry, shrinking away from the dark figure.
            Then, as if her cry had loosened Grace's tongue, she began:</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'<character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> Barclay, did I ever do you any
                harm?'</quote> Grace did not know how often her want of loving-kindness had pierced
            the tender heart of the stranger under her roof; nor did <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> remember it against her now. Instead, <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>'s memory was filled with grateful thoughts of
            how much that might have been left undone, by a less conscientious person, her aunt had
            done for her, and she half stretched out her arms as to a friend in that desolate place,
            while she answered:</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Oh no, no you were very good! very kind!'</quote></p>
        <p> But Grace stood immovable.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'I did you no harm, although I never rightly knew why you came to
            us.'</quote></p>
        <p>
            <quote>'I was sent by my mother on her death-bed,'</quote> moaned <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, covering her face. It grew darker every
            instant. Her aunt stood, still and silent.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Did any of mine ever wrong you?'</quote> she asked, after a time.</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'No, no; never, till <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character> said—Oh,
                aunt, do you think I am a witch?'</quote> And now <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> was standing up, holding by Grace's cloak, and trying to read her
            face. Grace drew herself, ever so little, away from the girl, whom she dreaded, and yet
            sought to propitiate.</p>
        <p> 'Wiser than I, godlier than I, have said it. But oh, <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>! he was my
            first-born. Loose him from the demon, for the sake of Him whose name I dare not name in
            this terrible building, filled with them who have renounced the hopes of their baptism;
            loose <character ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> from his awful state, if ever I or
            mine did you a kindness!'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'You ask me for Christ'</quote>s sake,<quote>' said <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                    >Lois</character>. '</quote>I can name that holy name—for oh, aunt! indeed, and
            in holy truth, I am no witch; and yet I am to die—to be hanged! Aunt, do not let them
            kill me! I am so young, and I never did any one any harm that I know of.'</p>
        <p> 'Hush! for very shame! This afternoon I have bound my first-born with strong cords, to
            keep him from doing himself or us a mischief—he is so frenzied. <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> Barclay, look here!<quote>' and Grace knelt down
                at her niece'</quote>s feet, and joined her hands as if in prayer—'I am a proud
            woman, God forgive me! and I never thought to kneel to any save to Him. And now I kneel
            at your feet, to pray you to release my children, more especially my son <character
                ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character>, from the spells you have put upon them.
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, hearken to me, and I will pray to
            the Almighty for you, if yet there may be mercy.'</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'I cannot do it; I never did you or yours any wrong. How can I undo it? How can
                I?'</quote> And she wrung her hands in intensity of conviction of the inutility of
            aught she could do.</p>
        <p> Here Grace got up, slowly, stiffly, and sternly. She stood aloof from the chained girl,
            in the remote corner of the prison cell near the door, ready to make her escape as soon
            as she had cursed the witch, who would not, or could not, undo the evil she had wrought.
            Grace lifted up her right hand, and held it up on high, as she doomed <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> to be accursed for ever, for her deadly sin, and
            her want of mercy even at this final hour. And, lastly, she summoned her to meet her at
            the judgment-seat, and answer for this deadly injury done to both souls and bodies of
            those who had taken her in, and received her when she came to them an orphan and a
            stranger.</p>
        <p> Until this last summons, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> had stood as one
            who hears her sentence and can say nothing against it, for she knows all would be in
            vain. But she raised her head when she heard her aunt speak of the judgment-seat, and at
            the end of Grace's speech she, too, lifted up her right hand, as if solemnly pledging
            herself by that action, and replied:</p>
        <p> 'Aunt! I will meet you there. And there you will know my innocence of this deadly thing.
            God have mercy on you and yours!'</p>
        <p> Her calm voice maddened Grace, and making a gesture as if she plucked up a handful of
            dust of the floor, and threw it at <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, she
            cried:</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'Witch! witch! ask mercy for thyself—I need not your prayers. Witches'</quote>
            prayers are read backwards. I spit at thee, and defy thee!' And so she went away.</p>
        <p>
            <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> sat moaning that whole night through.
                <quote>'God comfort me! God strengthen me!'</quote> was all she could remember to
            say. She just felt that want, nothing more,—all other fears and wants seemed dead within
            her. And when the gaoler brought in her breakfast the next morning, he reported her as
                <quote>'gone silly;'</quote> for, indeed, she did not seem to know him, but kept
            rocking herself to and fro, and whispering softly to herself, smiling a little from time
            to time.</p>
        <p> But God did comfort her, and strengthen her too late on that Wednesday afternoon, they
            thrust another <quote>'witch'</quote> into her cell, bidding the two, with opprobrious
            words, keep company together. The new comer fell prostrate with the push given her from
            without; and <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, not recognizing anything
            but an old ragged woman lying helpless on her face on the ground, lifted her up; and lo!
            it was <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character>—dirty, filthy indeed, mud-pelted,
            stone-bruised, beaten, and all astray in her wits with the treatment she had received
            from the mob outside. <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> held her in her
            arms, and softly wiped the old brown wrinkled face with her apron, crying over it, as
            she had hardly yet cried over her own sorrows. For hours she tended the old Indian
            woman—tended her bodily woes; and as the poor scattered senses of the savage creature
            came slowly back, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> gathered her infinite
            dread of the morrow, when she too, as well as <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>, was to be led out to die, in face of all that infuriated crowd.
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> sought in her own mind for some
            source of comfort for the old woman, who shook like one in the shaking palsy at the
            dread of death—and such a death.</p>
        <p> When all was quiet through the prison, in the deep dead midnight, the gaoler outside the
            door heard <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> telling, as if to a young
            child, the marvellous and sorrowful story of one who died on the cross for us and for
            our sakes. As long as she spoke, the Indian woman's terror seemed lulled; but the
            instant she paused, for weariness, <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> cried out
            afresh, as if some wild beast were following her close through the dense forests in
            which she had dwelt in her youth. And then <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> went on, saying all the blessed words she could remember, and
            comforting the helpless Indian woman with the sense of the presence of a Heavenly
            Friend. And in comforting her, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was
            comforted; in strengthening her, <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> was
            strengthened.</p>
        <p> The morning came, and the summons to come forth and die came. They who entered the cell
            found <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> asleep, her face resting on the
            slumbering old woman, whose head she still held in her lap. She did not seem clearly to
            recognize where she was, when she awakened; the <quote>'silly'</quote> look had returned
            to her wan face; all she appeared to know was, that somehow or another, through some
            peril or another, she had to protect the poor Indian woman. She smiled faintly when she
            saw the bright light of the April day; and put her arm round <character ref="Nattee"
                >Nattee</character>, and tried to keep the Indian quiet with hushing, soothing words
            of broken meaning, and holy fragments of the Psalms. <character ref="Nattee"
                >Nattee</character> tightened her hold upon <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> as they drew near the gallows, and the outrageous crowd below
            began to hoot and yell. <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> redoubled her
            efforts to calm and encourage <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character>, apparently
            unconscious that any of the opprobrium, the hootings, the stones, the mud, was directed
            towards her herself. But when they took <character ref="Nattee">Nattee</character> from
            her arms, and led her out to suffer first, <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character> seemed all at once to recover her sense of the present terror. She
            gazed wildly around, stretched out her arms as if to some person in the distance, who
            was yet visible to her, and cried out once with a voice that thrilled through all who
            heard it, <quote>'Mother!'</quote> Directly afterwards, the body of <character
                ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> the Witch swung in the air, and every one stood,
            with hushed breath, with a sudden wonder, like a fear of deadly crime, fallen upon
            them.</p>
        <p> The stillness and the silence were broken by one crazed and mad, who came rushing up the
            steps of the ladder, and caught <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>'s body in
            his arms, and kissed her lips with wild passion. And then, as if it were true what the
            people believed, that he was possessed by a demon, he sprang down, and rushed through
            the crowd, out of the bounds of the city, and into the dark dense forest, and <character
                ref="Manasseh">Manasseh</character> Hickson was no more seen of Christian man.</p>
        <p> The people of Salem had awakened from their frightful delusion before the autumn, when
                <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse</character> and Ralph Lucy
            came to find out <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character>, and bring her home to
            peaceful Barford, in the pleasant country of England. Instead, they led them to the
            grassy grave where she lay at rest, done to death by mistaken men. Ralph Lucy shook the
            dust off his feet in quitting Salem, with a heavy, heavy heart; and lived a bachelor all
            his life long for her sake.</p>
        <p> Long years afterwards, <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain
                Holdernesse</character> sought him out, to tell him some news that he thought might
            interest the grave miller of the Avonside. <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain
                Holdernesse</character> told him that in the previous year, it was then
                <year>1713</year>, the sentence of excommunication against the witches of Salem was
            ordered, in godly sacramental meeting of the church, to be erased and blotted out, and
            that those who met together for this purpose 'humbly requested the merciful God would
            pardon whatsoever sin, error, or mistake was in the application of justice, through our
            merciful High Priest, who knoweth how to have compassion on the ignorant, and those that
            are out of the way.' He also said that <character ref="Prudence">Prudence</character>
            Hickson—now woman grown—had made a most touching and pungent declaration of sorrow and
            repentance before the whole church, for the false and mistaken testimony she had given
            in several instances, among which she particularly mentioned that of her cousin
                <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> Barclay. To all which Ralph Lucy only
            answered:</p>
        <p>
            <quote>'No repentance of theirs can bring her back to life.'</quote></p>
        <p> Then <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse</character> took out a
            paper, and read the following humble and solemn declaration of regret on the part of
            those who signed it, among whom <character ref="Grace Hickson">Grace Hickson</character>
            was one:</p>
        <p> 'We, whose names are undersigned, being, in the year <year>1692</year>, called to serve
            as jurors in court of Salem, on trial of many who were by some suspected guilty of doing
            acts of witchcraft upon the bodies of sundry persons; we confess that we ourselves were
            not capable to understand, nor able to withstand, the mysterious delusions of the powers
            of darkness, and prince of the air, but were, for want of knowledge in ourselves, and
            better information from others, prevailed with to take up with such evidence against the
            accused, as, on further consideration, and better information, we justly fear was
            insufficient for the touching the lives of any (Deut. xvii. 6), whereby we fear we have
            been instrumental, with others, though ignorantly and unwittingly, to bring upon
            ourselves and this people of the Lord the guilt of innocent blood; which sin, the Lord
            saith in Scripture, he would not pardon (2 Kings, xxiv. 4), that is, we suppose, in
            regard of his temporal judgments. We do, therefore, signify to all in general (and to
            the surviving sufferers in special) our deep sense of, and sorrow for, our errors, in
            acting on such evidence to the condemning of any person; and do hereby declare, that we
            justly fear that we were sadly deluded and mistaken, for which we are much disquieted
            and distressed in our minds, and do therefore humbly beg forgiveness, first of God for
            Christ's sake, for this our error; and pray that God would not impute the guilt of it to
            ourselves nor others; and we also pray that we may be considered candidly and aright by
            the living sufferers, as being then under the power of a strong and general delusion,
            utterly unacquainted with, and not experienced in, matters of that nature.</p>
        <p> 'We do heartily ask forgiveness of you all, whom we have justly offended; and do
            declare, according to our present minds, we would none of us do such things again on
            such grounds for the whole world; praying you to accept of this in way of satisfaction
            for our offence, and that you would bless the inheritance of the Lord, that he may be
            entreated for the land.</p>

        <p> To the reading of this paper Ralph Lucy made no reply save this, even more gloomily than
            before:</p>
        <p> 'All their repentance will avail nothing to my <character ref="Lois Barclay"
                >Lois</character>, nor will it bring back her life.'</p>
        <p> Then <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse </character>spoke once
            more, and said that on the day of the general fast, appointed to be held all through New
            England, when the meeting-houses were crowded, an old, old man with white hair had stood
            up in the place in which he was accustomed to worship, and had handed up into the pulpit
            a written confession, which he had once or twice essayed to read for himself,
            acknowledging his great and grievous error in the matter of the witches of Salem, and
            praying for the forgiveness of God and of his people, ending with an entreaty that all
            then present would join with him in prayer that his past conduct might not bring down
            the displeasure of the Most High upon his country, his family, or himself. That old man,
            who was no other than Justice Sewall, remained standing all the time that his confession
            was read; and at the end he said, 'The good and gracious God be pleased to save New
            England and me and my family.' And then it came out that, for years past, Judge Sewall
            had set apart a day for humiliation and prayer, to keep fresh in his mind a sense of
            repentance and sorrow for the part he had borne in these trials, and that this solemn
            anniversary he was pledged to keep as long as he lived, to show his feeling of deep
            humiliation.</p>
        <p> Ralph Lucy's voice trembled as he spoke:</p>
        <p> 'All this will not bring my <character ref="Lois Barclay">Lois</character> to life
            again, or give me back the hope of my youth.'</p>
        <p> But—as <character ref="Captain Holdernesse">Captain Holdernesse</character> shook his
            head (for what word could he say, or how dispute what was so evidently true?)—Ralph
            added, 'What is the day, know you, that this justice has set apart?'</p>

            <quote>'Then on that day will I, here at Barford in England, join my prayer as long as I
                live with the repentant judge, that his sin may be blotted out and no more had in
                remembrance. She would have willed it so.'</quote>
