<h3>THE MORTALS IN THE HOUSE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> none of the accredited
ghostly circumstances, and environed by none of the conventional
ghostly surroundings, did I first make acquaintance with the
house which is the subject of this Christmas piece.&nbsp; I saw
it in the daylight, with the sun upon it.&nbsp; There was no
wind, no rain, no lightning, no thunder, no awful or unwonted
circumstance, of any kind, to heighten its effect.&nbsp; More
than that: I had come to it direct from a railway station: it was
not more than a mile distant from the railway station; and, as I
stood outside the house, looking back upon the way I had come, I
could see the goods train running smoothly along the embankment
in the valley.&nbsp; I will not say that everything was utterly
commonplace, because I doubt if anything can be that, except to
utterly commonplace people—and there my vanity steps in;
but, I will take it on myself to say that anybody might see the
house as I saw it, any fine autumn morning.</p>
<p>The manner of my lighting on it was this.</p>
<p>I was travelling towards London out of the North, intending to
stop by the way, to look at the house.&nbsp; My health required a
temporary residence in the country; and a friend of mine who knew
that, and who had happened to drive past the house, had written
to me to suggest it as a likely place.&nbsp; I had got into the
train at midnight, and had fallen asleep, and had woke up and had
sat looking out of window at the brilliant Northern Lights in the
sky, and had fallen asleep again, and had woke up again to find
the night gone, with the usual discontented conviction on me that
I hadn’t been to sleep at all;—upon which question,
in the first imbecility of that condition, I am ashamed to
believe that I would have done wager by battle with the <a id="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>man who sat
opposite me.&nbsp; That opposite man had had, through the
night—as that opposite man always has—several legs
too many, and all of them too long.&nbsp; In addition to this
unreasonable conduct (which was only to be expected of him), he
had had a pencil and a pocket-book, and had been perpetually
listening and taking notes.&nbsp; It had appeared to me that
these aggravating notes related to the jolts and bumps of the
carriage, and I should have resigned myself to his taking them,
under a general supposition that he was in the civil-engineering
way of life, if he had not sat staring straight over my head
whenever he listened.&nbsp; He was a goggle-eyed gentleman of a
perplexed aspect, and his demeanour became unbearable.</p>
<p>It was a cold, dead morning (the sun not being up yet), and
when I had out-watched the paling light of the fires of the iron
country, and the curtain of heavy smoke that hung at once between
me and the stars and between me and the day, I turned to my
fellow-traveller and said:</p>
<p>“I <i>beg</i> your pardon, sir, but do you observe
anything particular in me?”&nbsp; For, really, he appeared
to be taking down, either my travelling-cap or my hair, with a
minuteness that was a liberty.</p>
<p>The goggle-eyed gentleman withdrew his eyes from behind me, as
if the back of the carriage were a hundred miles off, and said,
with a lofty look of compassion for my insignificance:</p>
<p>“In you, sir?—B.”</p>
<p>“B, sir?” said I, growing warm.</p>
<p>“I have nothing to do with you, sir,” returned the
gentleman; “pray let me listen—O.”</p>
<p>He enunciated this vowel after a pause, and noted it down.</p>
<p>At first I was alarmed, for an Express lunatic and no
communication with the guard, is a serious position.&nbsp; The
thought came to my relief that the gentleman might be what is
popularly called a Rapper: one of a sect for (some of) whom I
have the highest respect, but whom I don’t believe
in.&nbsp; I was going to ask him the question, when he took the
bread out of my mouth.</p>
<p>“You will excuse me,” said the gentleman
contemptuously, “if I am too much in advance of common
humanity to trouble myself at all about it.&nbsp; I have passed
the night—as indeed I pass the whole of my time
now—in spiritual intercourse.”</p>
<p>“O!” said I, somewhat snappishly.</p>
<p>“The conferences of the night began,” continued
the gentleman, turning several leaves of his note-book,
“with this message: ‘Evil communications corrupt good
manners.’”</p>
<p>“Sound,” said I; “but, absolutely
new?”</p>
<p>“New from spirits,” returned the gentleman.</p>
<p>I could only repeat my rather snappish “O!” and
ask if I might be favoured with the last communication.</p>
<p>“‘A bird in the hand,’” said the
gentleman, reading his last entry with great solemnity,
“‘is worth two in the Bosh.’”</p>
<p><a id="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>“Truly I am of the same opinion,” said I;
“but shouldn’t it be Bush?”</p>
<p>“It came to me, Bosh,” returned the gentleman.</p>
<p>The gentleman then informed me that the spirit of Socrates had
delivered this special revelation in the course of the
night.&nbsp; “My friend, I hope you are pretty well.&nbsp;
There are two in this railway carriage.&nbsp; How do you
do?&nbsp; There are seventeen thousand four hundred and
seventy-nine spirits here, but you cannot see them.&nbsp;
Pythagoras is here.&nbsp; He is not at liberty to mention it, but
hopes you like travelling.”&nbsp; Galileo likewise had
dropped in, with this scientific intelligence.&nbsp; “I am
glad to see you, <i>amico</i>.&nbsp; <i>Come sta</i>?&nbsp; Water
will freeze when it is cold enough.&nbsp;
<i>Addio</i>!”&nbsp; In the course of the night, also, the
following phenomena had occurred.&nbsp; Bishop Butler had
insisted on spelling his name, “Bubler,” for which
offence against orthography and good manners he had been
dismissed as out of temper.&nbsp; John Milton (suspected of
wilful mystification) had repudiated the authorship of Paradise
Lost, and had introduced, as joint authors of that poem, two
Unknown gentlemen, respectively named Grungers and
Scadgingtone.&nbsp; And Prince Arthur, nephew of King John of
England, had described himself as tolerably comfortable in the
seventh circle, where he was learning to paint on velvet, under
the direction of Mrs. Trimmer and Mary Queen of Scots.</p>
<p>If this should meet the eye of the gentleman who favoured me
with these disclosures, I trust he will excuse my confessing that
the sight of the rising sun, and the contemplation of the
magnificent Order of the vast Universe, made me impatient of
them.&nbsp; In a word, I was so impatient of them, that I was
mightily glad to get out at the next station, and to exchange
these clouds and vapours for the free air of Heaven.</p>
<p>By that time it was a beautiful morning.&nbsp; As I walked
away among such leaves as had already fallen from the golden,
brown, and russet trees; and as I looked around me on the wonders
of Creation, and thought of the steady, unchanging, and
harmonious laws by which they are sustained; the
gentleman’s spiritual intercourse seemed to me as poor a
piece of journey-work as ever this world saw.&nbsp; In which
heathen state of mind, I came within view of the house, and
stopped to examine it attentively.</p>
<p>It was a solitary house, standing in a sadly neglected garden:
a pretty even square of some two acres.&nbsp; It was a house of
about the time of George the Second; as stiff, as cold, as
formal, and in as bad taste, as could possibly be desired by the
most loyal admirer of the whole quartet of Georges.&nbsp; It was
uninhabited, but had, within a year or two, been cheaply repaired
to render it habitable; I say cheaply, because the work had been
done in a surface manner, and was already decaying as to the
paint and plaster, though the colours were fresh.&nbsp; A
lop-sided board drooped over the garden wall, announcing that it
was “to let on very reasonable terms, well <a id="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>furnished.”&nbsp; It was much too closely and
heavily shadowed by trees, and, in particular, there were six
tall poplars before the front windows, which were excessively
melancholy, and the site of which had been extremely ill
chosen.</p>
<p>It was easy to see that it was an avoided house—a house
that was shunned by the village, to which my eye was guided by a
church spire some half a mile off—a house that nobody would
take.&nbsp; And the natural inference was, that it had the
reputation of being a haunted house.</p>

</a></p>
<p>No period within the four-and-twenty hours of day and night is
so solemn to me, as the early morning.&nbsp; In the summer-time,
I often rise very early, and repair to my room to do a
day’s work before breakfast, and I am always on those
occasions deeply impressed by the stillness and solitude around
me.&nbsp; Besides that there is something awful in the being
surrounded by familiar faces asleep—in the knowledge that
those who are dearest to us and to whom we are dearest, are
profoundly unconscious of us, in an impassive state, anticipative
of that mysterious condition to which we are all
tending—the stopped life, the broken threads of yesterday,
the deserted seat, the closed book, the unfinished but abandoned
occupation, all are images of Death.&nbsp; The tranquillity of
the hour is the tranquillity of Death.&nbsp; The colour and the
chill have the same association.&nbsp; Even a certain air that
familiar household objects take upon them when they first emerge
from the shadows of the night into the morning, of being newer,
and as they used to be long ago, has its counterpart in the
subsidence of the worn face of maturity or age, in death, into
the old youthful look.&nbsp; Moreover, I once saw the apparition
of my father, at this hour.&nbsp; He was alive and well, and
nothing ever came of it, but I saw him in the daylight, sitting
with his back towards me, on a seat that stood beside my
bed.&nbsp; His head was resting on his hand, and whether he was
slumbering or grieving, I could not discern.&nbsp; Amazed to see
him there, I sat up, moved my position, leaned out of bed, and
watched him.&nbsp; As he did not move, I spoke to him more than
once.&nbsp; As he did not move then, I became alarmed and laid my
hand upon his shoulder, as I thought—and there was no such
thing.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, and for others less easily and briefly
statable, I find the early morning to be my most ghostly
time.&nbsp; Any house would be more or less haunted, to me, in
the early morning; and a haunted house could scarcely address me
to greater advantage than then.</p>
<p>I walked on into the village, with the desertion of this house
upon my mind, and I found the landlord of the little inn, sanding
his door-step.&nbsp; I bespoke breakfast, and broached the
subject of the house.</p>
<p>“Is it haunted?” I asked.</p>
<p>The landlord looked at me, shook his head, and answered,
“I say nothing.”</p>
<p>“Then it <i>is</i> haunted?”</p>
<p><a id="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>“Well!” cried the landlord, in an outburst
of frankness that had the appearance of
desperation—“I wouldn’t sleep in it.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“If I wanted to have all the bells in a house ring, with
nobody to ring ’em; and all the doors in a house bang, with
nobody to bang ’em; and all sorts of feet treading about,
with no feet there; why, then,” said the landlord,
“I’d sleep in that house.”</p>
<p>“Is anything seen there?”</p>
<p>The landlord looked at me again, and then, with his former
appearance of desperation, called down his stable-yard for
“Ikey!”</p>
<p>The call produced a high-shouldered young fellow, with a round
red face, a short crop of sandy hair, a very broad humorous
mouth, a turned-up nose, and a great sleeved waistcoat of purple
bars, with mother-of-pearl buttons, that seemed to be growing
upon him, and to be in a fair way—if it were not
pruned—of covering his head and overunning his boots.</p>
<p>“This gentleman wants to know,” said the landlord,
“if anything’s seen at the Poplars.”</p>
<p>“’Ooded woman with a howl,” said Ikey, in a
state of great freshness.</p>
<p>“Do you mean a cry?”</p>
<p>“I mean a bird, sir.”</p>
<p>“A hooded woman with an owl.&nbsp; Dear me!&nbsp; Did
you ever see her?”</p>
<p>“I seen the howl.”</p>
<p>“Never the woman?”</p>
<p>“Not so plain as the howl, but they always keeps
together.”</p>
<p>“Has anybody ever seen the woman as plainly as the
owl?”</p>
<p>“Lord bless you, sir!&nbsp; Lots.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“Lord bless you, sir!&nbsp; Lots.”</p>
<p>“The general-dealer opposite, for instance, who is
opening his shop?”</p>
<p>“Perkins?&nbsp; Bless you, Perkins wouldn’t go
a-nigh the place.&nbsp; No!” observed the young man, with
considerable feeling; “he an’t overwise, an’t
Perkins, but he an’t such a fool as <i>that</i>.”</p>
<p>(Here, the landlord murmured his confidence in Perkins’s
knowing better.)</p>
<p>“Who is—or who was—the hooded woman with the
owl?&nbsp; Do you know?”</p>
<p>“Well!” said Ikey, holding up his cap with one
hand while he scratched his head with the other, “they say,
in general, that she was murdered, and the howl he ’ooted
the while.”</p>
<p>This very concise summary of the facts was all I could learn,
except that a young man, as hearty and likely a young man as ever
I see, had been took with fits and held down in ’em, after
seeing the hooded woman.&nbsp; Also, that a personage, dimly
described as “a hold chap, a <a id="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>sort of one-eyed tramp, answering to
the name of Joby, unless you challenged him as Greenwood, and
then he said, ‘Why not? and even if so, mind your own
business,’” had encountered the hooded woman, a
matter of five or six times.&nbsp; But, I was not materially
assisted by these witnesses: inasmuch as the first was in
California, and the last was, as Ikey said (and he was confirmed
by the landlord), Anywheres.</p>
<p>Now, although I regard with a hushed and solemn fear, the
mysteries, between which and this state of existence is
interposed the barrier of the great trial and change that fall on
all the things that live; and although I have not the audacity to
pretend that I know anything of them; I can no more reconcile the
mere banging of doors, ringing of bells, creaking of boards, and
such-like insignificances, with the majestic beauty and pervading
analogy of all the Divine rules that I am permitted to
understand, than I had been able, a little while before, to yoke
the spiritual intercourse of my fellow-traveller to the chariot
of the rising sun.&nbsp; Moreover, I had lived in two haunted
houses—both abroad.&nbsp; In one of these, an old Italian
palace, which bore the reputation of being very badly haunted
indeed, and which had recently been twice abandoned on that
account, I lived eight months, most tranquilly and pleasantly:
notwithstanding that the house had a score of mysterious
bedrooms, which were never used, and possessed, in one large room
in which I sat reading, times out of number at all hours, and
next to which I slept, a haunted chamber of the first
pretensions.&nbsp; I gently hinted these considerations to the
landlord.&nbsp; And as to this particular house having a bad
name, I reasoned with him, Why, how many things had bad names
undeservedly, and how easy it was to give bad names, and did he
not think that if he and I were persistently to whisper in the
village that any weird-looking, old drunken tinker of the
neighbourhood had sold himself to the Devil, he would come in
time to be suspected of that commercial venture!&nbsp; All this
wise talk was perfectly ineffective with the landlord, I am bound
to confess, and was as dead a failure as ever I made in my
life.</p>
<p>To cut this part of the story short, I was piqued about the
haunted house, and was already half resolved to take it.&nbsp;
So, after breakfast, I got the keys from Perkins’s
brother-in-law (a whip and harness maker, who keeps the Post
Office, and is under submission to a most rigorous wife of the
Doubly Seceding Little Emmanuel persuasion), and went up to the
house, attended by my landlord and by Ikey.</p>
<p>Within, I found it, as I had expected, transcendently
dismal.&nbsp; The slowly changing shadows waved on it from the
heavy trees, were doleful in the last degree; the house was
ill-placed, ill-built, ill-planned, and ill-fitted.&nbsp; It was
damp, it was not free from dry rot, there was a flavour of rats
in it, and it was the gloomy victim of that indescribable decay
which settles on all the work of man’s hands whenever
it’s not turned to man’s account.&nbsp; The kitchens
and offices <a id="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>were too large, and too remote from each other.&nbsp;
Above stairs and below, waste tracts of passage intervened
between patches of fertility represented by rooms; and there was
a mouldy old well with a green growth upon it, hiding like a
murderous trap, near the bottom of the back-stairs, under the
double row of bells.&nbsp; One of these bells was labelled, on a
black ground in faded white letters, <span class="smcap">Master</span> B.&nbsp; This, they told me, was the
bell that rang the most.</p>
<p>“Who was Master B.?” I asked.&nbsp; “Is it
known what he did while the owl hooted?”</p>
<p>“Rang the bell,” said Ikey.</p>
<p>I was rather struck by the prompt dexterity with which this
young man pitched his fur cap at the bell, and rang it
himself.&nbsp; It was a loud, unpleasant bell, and made a very
disagreeable sound.&nbsp; The other bells were inscribed
according to the names of the rooms to which their wires were
conducted: as “Picture Room,” “Double
Room,” “Clock Room,” and the like.&nbsp;
Following Master B.’s bell to its source I found that young
gentleman to have had but indifferent third-class accommodation
in a triangular cabin under the cock-loft, with a corner
fireplace which Master B. must have been exceedingly small if he
were ever able to warm himself at, and a corner chimney-piece
like a pyramidal staircase to the ceiling for Tom Thumb.&nbsp;
The papering of one side of the room had dropped down bodily,
with fragments of plaster adhering to it, and almost blocked up
the door.&nbsp; It appeared that Master B., in his spiritual
condition, always made a point of pulling the paper down.&nbsp;
Neither the landlord nor Ikey could suggest why he made such a
fool of himself.</p>
<p>Except that the house had an immensely large rambling loft at
top, I made no other discoveries.&nbsp; It was moderately well
furnished, but sparely.&nbsp; Some of the furniture—say, a
third—was as old as the house; the rest was of various
periods within the last half-century.&nbsp; I was referred to a
corn-chandler in the market-place of the county town to treat for
the house.&nbsp; I went that day, and I took it for six
months.</p>
<p>It was just the middle of October when I moved in with my
maiden sister (I venture to call her eight-and-thirty, she is so
very handsome, sensible, and engaging).&nbsp; We took with us, a
deaf stable-man, my bloodhound Turk, two women servants, and a
young person called an Odd Girl.&nbsp; I have reason to record of
the attendant last enumerated, who was one of the Saint
Lawrence’s Union Female Orphans, that she was a fatal
mistake and a disastrous engagement.</p>
<p>The year was dying early, the leaves were falling fast, it was
a raw cold day when we took possession, and the gloom of the
house was most depressing.&nbsp; The cook (an amiable woman, but
of a weak turn of intellect) burst into tears on beholding the
kitchen, and requested that her silver watch might be delivered
over to her sister (2 Tuppintock’s Gardens, Liggs’s
Walk, Clapham Rise), in the event of anything happening to her
from the damp.&nbsp; Streaker, the housemaid, feigned <a id="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>cheerfulness, but was the greater martyr.&nbsp; The Odd
Girl, who had never been in the country, alone was pleased, and
made arrangements for sowing an acorn in the garden outside the
scullery window, and rearing an oak.</p>
<p>We went, before dark, through all the natural—as opposed
to supernatural—miseries incidental to our state.&nbsp;
Dispiriting reports ascended (like the smoke) from the basement
in volumes, and descended from the upper rooms.&nbsp; There was
no rolling-pin, there was no salamander (which failed to surprise
me, for I don’t know what it is), there was nothing in the
house, what there was, was broken, the last people must have
lived like pigs, what could the meaning of the landlord be?&nbsp;
Through these distresses, the Odd Girl was cheerful and
exemplary.&nbsp; But within four hours after dark we had got into
a supernatural groove, and the Odd Girl had seen
“Eyes,” and was in hysterics.</p>
<p>My sister and I had agreed to keep the haunting strictly to
ourselves, and my impression was, and still is, that I had not
left Ikey, when he helped to unload the cart, alone with the
women, or any one of them, for one minute.&nbsp; Nevertheless, as
I say, the Odd Girl had “seen Eyes” (no other
explanation could ever be drawn from her), before nine, and by
ten o’clock had had as much vinegar applied to her as would
pickle a handsome salmon.</p>
<p>I leave a discerning public to judge of my feelings, when,
under these untoward circumstances, at about half-past ten
o’clock Master B.’s bell began to ring in a most
infuriated manner, and Turk howled until the house resounded with
his lamentations!</p>
<p>I hope I may never again be in a state of mind so unchristian
as the mental frame in which I lived for some weeks, respecting
the memory of Master B.&nbsp; Whether his bell was rung by rats,
or mice, or bats, or wind, or what other accidental vibration, or
sometimes by one cause, sometimes another, and sometimes by
collusion, I don’t know; but, certain it is, that it did
ring two nights out of three, until I conceived the happy idea of
twisting Master B.’s neck—in other words, breaking
his bell short off—and silencing that young gentleman, as
to my experience and belief, for ever.</p>
<p>But, by that time, the Odd Girl had developed such improving
powers of catalepsy, that she had become a shining example of
that very inconvenient disorder.&nbsp; She would stiffen, like a
Guy Fawkes endowed with unreason, on the most irrelevant
occasions.&nbsp; I would address the servants in a lucid manner,
pointing out to them that I had painted Master B.’s room
and balked the paper, and taken Master B.’s bell away and
balked the ringing, and if they could suppose that that
confounded boy had lived and died, to clothe himself with no
better behaviour than would most unquestionably have brought him
and the sharpest particles of a birch-broom into close
acquaintance in the present imperfect state of existence, could
they also suppose a mere poor human being, such as I was, capable
by <a id="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>those
contemptible means of counteracting and limiting the powers of
the disembodied spirits of the dead, or of any spirits?—I
say I would become emphatic and cogent, not to say rather
complacent, in such an address, when it would all go for nothing
by reason of the Odd Girl’s suddenly stiffening from the
toes upward, and glaring among us like a parochial
petrifaction.</p>
<p>Streaker, the housemaid, too, had an attribute of a most
discomfiting nature.&nbsp; I am unable to say whether she was of
an unusually lymphatic temperament, or what else was the matter
with her, but this young woman became a mere Distillery for the
production of the largest and most transparent tears I ever met
with.&nbsp; Combined with these characteristics, was a peculiar
tenacity of hold in those specimens, so that they didn’t
fall, but hung upon her face and nose.&nbsp; In this condition,
and mildly and deplorably shaking her head, her silence would
throw me more heavily than the Admirable Crichton could have done
in a verbal disputation for a purse of money.&nbsp; Cook,
likewise, always covered me with confusion as with a garment, by
neatly winding up the session with the protest that the Ouse was
wearing her out, and by meekly repeating her last wishes
regarding her silver watch.</p>
<p>As to our nightly life, the contagion of suspicion and fear
was among us, and there is no such contagion under the sky.&nbsp;
Hooded woman?&nbsp; According to the accounts, we were in a
perfect Convent of hooded women.&nbsp; Noises?&nbsp; With that
contagion downstairs, I myself have sat in the dismal parlour,
listening, until I have heard so many and such strange noises,
that they would have chilled my blood if I had not warmed it by
dashing out to make discoveries.&nbsp; Try this in bed, in the
dead of the night: try this at your own comfortable fire-side, in
the life of the night.&nbsp; You can fill any house with noises,
if you will, until you have a noise for every nerve in your
nervous system.</p>
<p>I repeat; the contagion of suspicion and fear was among us,
and there is no such contagion under the sky.&nbsp; The women
(their noses in a chronic state of excoriation from
smelling-salts) were always primed and loaded for a swoon, and
ready to go off with hair-triggers.&nbsp; The two elder detached
the Odd Girl on all expeditions that were considered doubly
hazardous, and she always established the reputation of such
adventures by coming back cataleptic.&nbsp; If Cook or Streaker
went overhead after dark, we knew we should presently hear a bump
on the ceiling; and this took place so constantly, that it was as
if a fighting man were engaged to go about the house,
administering a touch of his art which I believe is called The
Auctioneer, to every domestic he met with.</p>
<p>It was in vain to do anything.&nbsp; It was in vain to be
frightened, for the moment in one’s own person, by a real
owl, and then to show the owl.&nbsp; It was in vain to discover,
by striking an accidental discord on the piano, that Turk always
howled at particular notes and combinations.&nbsp; <a id="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>It was in
vain to be a Rhadamanthus with the bells, and if an unfortunate
bell rang without leave, to have it down inexorably and silence
it.&nbsp; It was in vain to fire up chimneys, let torches down
the well, charge furiously into suspected rooms and
recesses.&nbsp; We changed servants, and it was no better.&nbsp;
The new set ran away, and a third set came, and it was no
better.&nbsp; At last, our comfortable housekeeping got to be so
disorganised and wretched, that I one night dejectedly said to my
sister: “Patty, I begin to despair of our getting people to
go on with us here, and I think we must give this up.”</p>
<p>My sister, who is a woman of immense spirit, replied,
“No, John, don’t give it up.&nbsp; Don’t be
beaten, John.&nbsp; There is another way.”</p>
<p>“And what is that?” said I.</p>
<p>“John,” returned my sister, “if we are not
to be driven out of this house, and that for no reason whatever,
that is apparent to you or me, we must help ourselves and take
the house wholly and solely into our own hands.”</p>
<p>“But, the servants,” said I.</p>
<p>“Have no servants,” said my sister, boldly.</p>
<p>Like most people in my grade of life, I had never thought of
the possibility of going on without those faithful
obstructions.&nbsp; The notion was so new to me when suggested,
that I looked very doubtful.&nbsp; “We know they come here
to be frightened and infect one another, and we know they are
frightened and do infect one another,” said my sister.</p>
<p>“With the exception of Bottles,” I observed, in a
meditative tone.</p>
<p>(The deaf stable-man.&nbsp; I kept him in my service, and
still keep him, as a phenomenon of moroseness not to be matched
in England.)</p>
<p>“To be sure, John,” assented my sister;
“except Bottles.&nbsp; And what does that go to
prove?&nbsp; Bottles talks to nobody, and hears nobody unless he
is absolutely roared at, and what alarm has Bottles ever given,
or taken!&nbsp; None.”</p>
<p>This was perfectly true; the individual in question having
retired, every night at ten o’clock, to his bed over the
coach-house, with no other company than a pitchfork and a pail of
water.&nbsp; That the pail of water would have been over me, and
the pitchfork through me, if I had put myself without
announcement in Bottles’s way after that minute, I had
deposited in my own mind as a fact worth remembering.&nbsp;
Neither had Bottles ever taken the least notice of any of our
many uproars.&nbsp; An imperturbable and speechless man, he had
sat at his supper, with Streaker present in a swoon, and the Odd
Girl marble, and had only put another potato in his cheek, or
profited by the general misery to help himself to beefsteak
pie.</p>
<p>“And so,” continued my sister, “I exempt
Bottles.&nbsp; And considering, John, that the house is too
large, and perhaps too lonely, to be kept well in hand by
Bottles, you, and me, I propose that we cast about among our
friends for a certain selected number of the most reliable and
willing—form a Society here for three months—wait
upon ourselves <a id="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>and one another—live cheerfully and
socially—and see what happens.”</p>
<p>I was so charmed with my sister, that I embraced her on the
spot, and went into her plan with the greatest ardour.</p>
<p>We were then in the third week of November; but, we took our
measures so vigorously, and were so well seconded by the friends
in whom we confided, that there was still a week of the month
unexpired, when our party all came down together merrily, and
mustered in the haunted house.</p>
<p>I will mention, in this place, two small changes that I made
while my sister and I were yet alone.&nbsp; It occurring to me as
not improbable that Turk howled in the house at night, partly
because he wanted to get out of it, I stationed him in his kennel
outside, but unchained; and I seriously warned the village that
any man who came in his way must not expect to leave him without
a rip in his own throat.&nbsp; I then casually asked Ikey if he
were a judge of a gun?&nbsp; On his saying, “Yes, sir, I
knows a good gun when I sees her,” I begged the favour of
his stepping up to the house and looking at mine.</p>
<p>“<i>She’s</i> a true one, sir,” said Ikey,
after inspecting a double-barrelled rifle that I bought in New
York a few years ago.&nbsp; “No mistake about <i>her</i>,
sir.”</p>
<p>“Ikey,” said I, “don’t mention it; I
have seen something in this house.”</p>
<p>“No, sir?” he whispered, greedily opening his
eyes.&nbsp; “’Ooded lady, sir?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be frightened,” said I.&nbsp;
“It was a figure rather like you.”</p>
<p>“Lord, sir?”</p>
<p>“Ikey!” said I, shaking hands with him warmly: I
may say affectionately; “if there is any truth in these
ghost-stories, the greatest service I can do you, is, to fire at
that figure.&nbsp; And I promise you, by Heaven and earth, I will
do it with this gun if I see it again!”</p>
<p>The young man thanked me, and took his leave with some little
precipitation, after declining a glass of liquor.&nbsp; I
imparted my secret to him, because I had never quite forgotten
his throwing his cap at the bell; because I had, on another
occasion, noticed something very like a fur cap, lying not far
from the bell, one night when it had burst out ringing; and
because I had remarked that we were at our ghostliest whenever he
came up in the evening to comfort the servants.&nbsp; Let me do
Ikey no injustice.&nbsp; He was afraid of the house, and believed
in its being haunted; and yet he would play false on the haunting
side, so surely as he got an opportunity.&nbsp; The Odd
Girl’s case was exactly similar.&nbsp; She went about the
house in a state of real terror, and yet lied monstrously and
wilfully, and invented many of the alarms she spread, and made
many of the sounds we heard.&nbsp; I had had my eye on the two,
and I know it.&nbsp; It is not necessary for me, here, to account
for this preposterous state of mind; I content myself with
remarking that it is familiarly known to every intelligent man
who <a id="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>has
had fair medical, legal, or other watchful experience; that it is
as well established and as common a state of mind as any with
which observers are acquainted; and that it is one of the first
elements, above all others, rationally to be suspected in, and
strictly looked for, and separated from, any question of this
kind.</p>
<p>To return to our party.&nbsp; The first thing we did when we
were all assembled, was, to draw lots for bedrooms.&nbsp; That
done, and every bedroom, and, indeed, the whole house, having
been minutely examined by the whole body, we allotted the various
household duties, as if we had been on a gipsy party, or a
yachting party, or a hunting party, or were shipwrecked.&nbsp; I
then recounted the floating rumours concerning the hooded lady,
the owl, and Master B.: with others, still more filmy, which had
floated about during our occupation, relative to some ridiculous
old ghost of the female gender who went up and down, carrying the
ghost of a round table; and also to an impalpable Jackass, whom
nobody was ever able to catch.&nbsp; Some of these ideas I really
believe our people below had communicated to one another in some
diseased way, without conveying them in words.&nbsp; We then
gravely called one another to witness, that we were not there to
be deceived, or to deceive—which we considered pretty much
the same thing—and that, with a serious sense of
responsibility, we would be strictly true to one another, and
would strictly follow out the truth.&nbsp; The understanding was
established, that any one who heard unusual noises in the night,
and who wished to trace them, should knock at my door; lastly,
that on Twelfth Night, the last night of holy Christmas, all our
individual experiences since that then present hour of our coming
together in the haunted house, should be brought to light for the
good of all; and that we would hold our peace on the subject till
then, unless on some remarkable provocation to break silence.</p>
<p>We were, in number and in character, as follows:</p>
<p>First—to get my sister and myself out of the
way—there were we two.&nbsp; In the drawing of lots, my
sister drew her own room, and I drew Master B.’s.&nbsp;
Next, there was our first cousin John Herschel, so called after
the great astronomer: than whom I suppose a better man at a
telescope does not breathe.&nbsp; With him, was his wife: a
charming creature to whom he had been married in the previous
spring.&nbsp; I thought it (under the circumstances) rather
imprudent to bring her, because there is no knowing what even a
false alarm may do at such a time; but I suppose he knew his own
business best, and I must say that if she had been <i>my</i>
wife, I never could have left her endearing and bright face
behind.&nbsp; They drew the Clock Room.&nbsp; Alfred Starling, an
uncommonly agreeable young fellow of eight-and-twenty for whom I
have the greatest liking, was in the Double Room; mine, usually,
and designated by that name from having a dressing-room within
it, with two large and cumbersome windows, which no wedges
<i>I</i> was ever able to make, would keep from shaking, in any
weather, <a id="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>wind or no wind.&nbsp; Alfred is a young fellow who
pretends to be “fast” (another word for loose, as I
understand the term), but who is much too good and sensible for
that nonsense, and who would have distinguished himself before
now, if his father had not unfortunately left him a small
independence of two hundred a year, on the strength of which his
only occupation in life has been to spend six.&nbsp; I am in
hopes, however, that his Banker may break, or that he may enter
into some speculation guaranteed to pay twenty per cent.; for, I
am convinced that if he could only be ruined, his fortune is
made.&nbsp; Belinda Bates, bosom friend of my sister, and a most
intellectual, amiable, and delightful girl, got the Picture
Room.&nbsp; She has a fine genius for poetry, combined with real
business earnestness, and “goes in”—to use an
expression of Alfred’s—for Woman’s mission,
Woman’s rights, Woman’s wrongs, and everything that
is woman’s with a capital W, or is not and ought to be, or
is and ought not to be.&nbsp; “Most praiseworthy, my dear,
and Heaven prosper you!” I whispered to her on the first
night of my taking leave of her at the Picture-Room door,
“but don’t overdo it.&nbsp; And in respect of the
great necessity there is, my darling, for more employments being
within the reach of Woman than our civilisation has as yet
assigned to her, don’t fly at the unfortunate men, even
those men who are at first sight in your way, as if they were the
natural oppressors of your sex; for, trust me, Belinda, they do
sometimes spend their wages among wives and daughters, sisters,
mothers, aunts, and grandmothers; and the play is, really, not
<i>all</i> Wolf and Red Riding-Hood, but has other parts in
it.”&nbsp; However, I digress.</p>
<p>Belinda, as I have mentioned, occupied the Picture Room.&nbsp;
We had but three other chambers: the Corner Room, the Cupboard
Room, and the Garden Room.&nbsp; My old friend, Jack Governor,
“slung his hammock,” as he called it, in the Corner
Room.&nbsp; I have always regarded Jack as the finest-looking
sailor that ever sailed.&nbsp; He is gray now, but as handsome as
he was a quarter of a century ago—nay, handsomer.&nbsp; A
portly, cheery, well-built figure of a broad-shouldered man, with
a frank smile, a brilliant dark eye, and a rich dark
eyebrow.&nbsp; I remember those under darker hair, and they look
all the better for their silver setting.&nbsp; He has been
wherever his Union namesake flies, has Jack, and I have met old
shipmates of his, away in the Mediterranean and on the other side
of the Atlantic, who have beamed and brightened at the casual
mention of his name, and have cried, “You know Jack
Governor?&nbsp; Then you know a prince of men!”&nbsp; That
he is!&nbsp; And so unmistakably a naval officer, that if you
were to meet him coming out of an Esquimaux snow-hut in
seal’s skin, you would be vaguely persuaded he was in full
naval uniform.</p>
<p>Jack once had that bright clear eye of his on my sister; but,
it fell out that he married another lady and took her to South
America, where she died.&nbsp; This was a dozen years ago or
more.&nbsp; He brought down with him to our haunted house a
little cask of salt beef; for, he <a id="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>is always convinced that all salt
beef not of his own pickling, is mere carrion, and invariably,
when he goes to London, packs a piece in his portmanteau.&nbsp;
He had also volunteered to bring with him one “Nat
Beaver,” an old comrade of his, captain of a
merchantman.&nbsp; Mr. Beaver, with a thick-set wooden face and
figure, and apparently as hard as a block all over, proved to be
an intelligent man, with a world of watery experiences in him,
and great practical knowledge.&nbsp; At times, there was a
curious nervousness about him, apparently the lingering result of
some old illness; but, it seldom lasted many minutes.&nbsp; He
got the Cupboard Room, and lay there next to Mr. Undery, my
friend and solicitor: who came down, in an amateur capacity,
“to go through with it,” as he said, and who plays
whist better than the whole Law List, from the red cover at the
beginning to the red cover at the end.</p>
<p>I never was happier in my life, and I believe it was the
universal feeling among us.&nbsp; Jack Governor, always a man of
wonderful resources, was Chief Cook, and made some of the best
dishes I ever ate, including unapproachable curries.&nbsp; My
sister was pastrycook and confectioner.&nbsp; Starling and I were
Cook’s Mate, turn and turn about, and on special occasions
the chief cook “pressed” Mr. Beaver.&nbsp; We had a
great deal of out-door sport and exercise, but nothing was
neglected within, and there was no ill-humour or misunderstanding
among us, and our evenings were so delightful that we had at
least one good reason for being reluctant to go to bed.</p>
<p>We had a few night alarms in the beginning.&nbsp; On the first
night, I was knocked up by Jack with a most wonderful
ship’s lantern in his hand, like the gills of some monster
of the deep, who informed me that he “was going aloft to
the main truck,” to have the weathercock down.&nbsp; It was
a stormy night and I remonstrated; but Jack called my attention
to its making a sound like a cry of despair, and said somebody
would be “hailing a ghost” presently, if it
wasn’t done.&nbsp; So, up to the top of the house, where I
could hardly stand for the wind, we went, accompanied by Mr.
Beaver; and there Jack, lantern and all, with Mr. Beaver after
him, swarmed up to the top of a cupola, some two dozen feet above
the chimneys, and stood upon nothing particular, coolly knocking
the weathercock off, until they both got into such good spirits
with the wind and the height, that I thought they would never
come down.&nbsp; Another night, they turned out again, and had a
chimney-cowl off.&nbsp; Another night, they cut a sobbing and
gulping water-pipe away.&nbsp; Another night, they found out
something else.&nbsp; On several occasions, they both, in the
coolest manner, simultaneously dropped out of their respective
bedroom windows, hand over hand by their counterpanes, to
“overhaul” something mysterious in the garden.</p>
<p>The engagement among us was faithfully kept, and nobody
revealed anything.&nbsp; All we knew was, if any one’s room
were haunted, no one looked the worse for it.</p>
<h3><a id="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>THE
GHOST IN MASTER B.’S ROOM.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I established myself in the
triangular garret which had gained so distinguished a reputation,
my thoughts naturally turned to Master B.&nbsp; My speculations
about him were uneasy and manifold.&nbsp; Whether his Christian
name was Benjamin, Bissextile (from his having been born in Leap
Year), Bartholomew, or Bill.&nbsp; Whether the initial letter
belonged to his family name, and that was Baxter, Black, Brown,
Barker, Buggins, Baker, or Bird.&nbsp; Whether he was a
foundling, and had been baptized B.&nbsp; Whether he was a
lion-hearted boy, and B. was short for Briton, or for Bull.&nbsp;
Whether he could possibly have been kith and kin to an
illustrious lady who brightened my own childhood, and had come of
the blood of the brilliant Mother Bunch?</p>
<p>With these profitless meditations I tormented myself
much.&nbsp; I also carried the mysterious letter into the
appearance and pursuits of the deceased; wondering whether he
dressed in Blue, wore Boots (he couldn’t have been Bald),
was a boy of Brains, liked Books, was good at Bowling, had any
skill as a Boxer, even in his Buoyant Boyhood Bathed from a
Bathing-machine at Bognor, Bangor, Bournemouth, Brighton, or
Broadstairs, like a Bounding Billiard Ball?</p>
<p>So, from the first, I was haunted by the letter B.</p>
<p>It was not long before I remarked that I never by any hazard
had a dream of Master B., or of anything belonging to him.&nbsp;
But, the instant I awoke from sleep, at whatever hour of the
night, my thoughts took him up, and roamed away, trying to attach
his initial letter to something that would fit it and keep it
quiet.</p>
<p>For six nights, I had been worried thus in Master B.’s
room, when I began to perceive that things were going wrong.</p>
<p>The first appearance that presented itself was early in the
morning when it was but just daylight and no more.&nbsp; I was
standing shaving at my glass, when I suddenly discovered, to my
consternation and amazement, that I was shaving—not
myself—I am fifty—but a boy.&nbsp; Apparently Master
B.!</p>
<p>I trembled and looked over my shoulder; nothing there.&nbsp; I
looked again in the glass, and distinctly saw the features and
expression of a boy, who was shaving, not to get rid of a beard,
but to get one.&nbsp; Extremely troubled in my mind, I took a few
turns in the room, and went back to the looking-glass, resolved
to steady my hand and complete the operation in which I had been
disturbed.&nbsp; Opening my eyes, which I had shut while
recovering my firmness, I now met in the glass, looking straight
at me, the eyes of a young man of four or five and twenty.&nbsp;
Terrified by this new ghost, I closed my eyes, and made a strong
effort to recover myself.&nbsp; Opening them again, I saw,
shaving his cheek in the glass, my father, who has long been
dead.&nbsp; Nay, I even saw my grandfather too, whom I never did
see in my life.</p>
<p><a id="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>Although naturally much affected by these remarkable
visitations, I determined to keep my secret, until the time
agreed upon for the present general disclosure.&nbsp; Agitated by
a multitude of curious thoughts, I retired to my room, that
night, prepared to encounter some new experience of a spectral
character.&nbsp; Nor was my preparation needless, for, waking
from an uneasy sleep at exactly two o’clock in the morning,
what were my feelings to find that I was sharing my bed with the
skeleton of Master B.!</p>
<p>I sprang up, and the skeleton sprang up also.&nbsp; I then
heard a plaintive voice saying, “Where am I?&nbsp; What is
become of me?” and, looking hard in that direction,
perceived the ghost of Master B.</p>
<p>The young spectre was dressed in an obsolete fashion: or
rather, was not so much dressed as put into a case of inferior
pepper-and-salt cloth, made horrible by means of shining
buttons.&nbsp; I observed that these buttons went, in a double
row, over each shoulder of the young ghost, and appeared to
descend his back.&nbsp; He wore a frill round his neck.&nbsp; His
right hand (which I distinctly noticed to be inky) was laid upon
his stomach; connecting this action with some feeble pimples on
his countenance, and his general air of nausea, I concluded this
ghost to be the ghost of a boy who had habitually taken a great
deal too much medicine.</p>
<p>“Where am I?” said the little spectre, in a
pathetic voice.&nbsp; “And why was I born in the Calomel
days, and why did I have all that Calomel given me?”</p>
<p>I replied, with sincere earnestness, that upon my soul I
couldn’t tell him.</p>
<p>“Where is my little sister,” said the ghost,
“and where my angelic little wife, and where is the boy I
went to school with?”</p>
<p>I entreated the phantom to be comforted, and above all things
to take heart respecting the loss of the boy he went to school
with.&nbsp; I represented to him that probably that boy never
did, within human experience, come out well, when
discovered.&nbsp; I urged that I myself had, in later life,
turned up several boys whom I went to school with, and none of
them had at all answered.&nbsp; I expressed my humble belief that
that boy never did answer.&nbsp; I represented that he was a
mythic character, a delusion, and a snare.&nbsp; I recounted how,
the last time I found him, I found him at a dinner party behind a
wall of white cravat, with an inconclusive opinion on every
possible subject, and a power of silent boredom absolutely
Titanic.&nbsp; I related how, on the strength of our having been
together at “Old Doylance’s,” he had asked
himself to breakfast with me (a social offence of the largest
magnitude); how, fanning my weak embers of belief in
Doylance’s boys, I had let him in; and how, he had proved
to be a fearful wanderer about the earth, pursuing the race of
Adam with inexplicable notions concerning the currency, and with
a proposition that the Bank of England should, on pain of being
abolished, instantly strike off and circulate, God knows how many
thousand millions of ten-and-sixpenny notes.</p>
<p><a id="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>The
ghost heard me in silence, and with a fixed stare.&nbsp;
“Barber!” it apostrophised me when I had
finished.</p>
<p>“Barber?” I repeated—for I am not of that
profession.</p>
<p>“Condemned,” said the ghost, “to shave a
constant change of customers—now, me—now, a young
man—now, thyself as thou art—now, thy
father—now, thy grandfather; condemned, too, to lie down
with a skeleton every night, and to rise with it every
morning—”</p>
<p>(I shuddered on hearing this dismal announcement.)</p>
<p>“Barber!&nbsp; Pursue me!”</p>
<p>I had felt, even before the words were uttered, that I was
under a spell to pursue the phantom.&nbsp; I immediately did so,
and was in Master B.’s room no longer.</p>
<p>Most people know what long and fatiguing night journeys had
been forced upon the witches who used to confess, and who, no
doubt, told the exact truth—particularly as they were
always assisted with leading questions, and the Torture was
always ready.&nbsp; I asseverate that, during my occupation of
Master B.’s room, I was taken by the ghost that haunted it,
on expeditions fully as long and wild as any of those.&nbsp;
Assuredly, I was presented to no shabby old man with a
goat’s horns and tail (something between Pan and an old
clothesman), holding conventional receptions, as stupid as those
of real life and less decent; but, I came upon other things which
appeared to me to have more meaning.</p>
<p>Confident that I speak the truth and shall be believed, I
declare without hesitation that I followed the ghost, in the
first instance on a broom-stick, and afterwards on a
rocking-horse.&nbsp; The very smell of the animal’s
paint—especially when I brought it out, by making him
warm—I am ready to swear to.&nbsp; I followed the ghost,
afterwards, in a hackney coach; an institution with the peculiar
smell of which, the present generation is unacquainted, but to
which I am again ready to swear as a combination of stable, dog
with the mange, and very old bellows.&nbsp; (In this, I appeal to
previous generations to confirm or refute me.)&nbsp; I pursued
the phantom, on a headless donkey: at least, upon a donkey who
was so interested in the state of his stomach that his head was
always down there, investigating it; on ponies, expressly born to
kick up behind; on roundabouts and swings, from fairs; in the
first cab—another forgotten institution where the fare
regularly got into bed, and was tucked up with the driver.</p>
<p>Not to trouble you with a detailed account of all my travels
in pursuit of the ghost of Master B., which were longer and more
wonderful than those of Sinbad the Sailor, I will confine myself
to one experience from which you may judge of many.</p>
<p>I was marvellously changed.&nbsp; I was myself, yet not
myself.&nbsp; I was conscious of something within me, which has
been the same all through my life, and which I have always
recognised under all its phases and varieties as never altering,
and yet I was not the I who had gone to bed in Master B.’s
room.&nbsp; I had the smoothest of faces and the <a id="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>shortest of
legs, and I had taken another creature like myself, also with the
smoothest of faces and the shortest of legs, behind a door, and
was confiding to him a proposition of the most astounding
nature.</p>
<p>This proposition was, that we should have a Seraglio.</p>
<p>The other creature assented warmly.&nbsp; He had no notion of
respectability, neither had I.&nbsp; It was the custom of the
East, it was the way of the good Caliph Haroun Alraschid (let me
have the corrupted name again for once, it is so scented with
sweet memories!), the usage was highly laudable, and most worthy
of imitation.&nbsp; “O, yes!&nbsp; Let us,” said the
other creature with a jump, “have a Seraglio.”</p>
<p>It was not because we entertained the faintest doubts of the
meritorious character of the Oriental establishment we proposed
to import, that we perceived it must be kept a secret from Miss
Griffin.&nbsp; It was because we knew Miss Griffin to be bereft
of human sympathies, and incapable of appreciating the greatness
of the great Haroun.&nbsp; Mystery impenetrably shrouded from
Miss Griffin then, let us entrust it to Miss Bule.</p>
<p>We were ten in Miss Griffin’s establishment by Hampstead
Ponds; eight ladies and two gentlemen.&nbsp; Miss Bule, whom I
judge to have attained the ripe age of eight or nine, took the
lead in society.&nbsp; I opened the subject to her in the course
of the day, and proposed that she should become the
Favourite.</p>
<p>Miss Bule, after struggling with the diffidence so natural to,
and charming in, her adorable sex, expressed herself as flattered
by the idea, but wished to know how it was proposed to provide
for Miss Pipson?&nbsp; Miss Bule—who was understood to have
vowed towards that young lady, a friendship, halves, and no
secrets, until death, on the Church Service and Lessons complete
in two volumes with case and lock—Miss Bule said she could
not, as the friend of Pipson, disguise from herself, or me, that
Pipson was not one of the common.</p>
<p>Now, Miss Pipson, having curly hair and blue eyes (which was
my idea of anything mortal and feminine that was called Fair), I
promptly replied that I regarded Miss Pipson in the light of a
Fair Circassian.</p>
<p>“And what then?” Miss Bule pensively asked.</p>
<p>I replied that she must be inveigled by a Merchant, brought to
me veiled, and purchased as a slave.</p>
<p>[The other creature had already fallen into the second male
place in the State, and was set apart for Grand Vizier.&nbsp; He
afterwards resisted this disposal of events, but had his hair
pulled until he yielded.]</p>
<p>“Shall I not be jealous?” Miss Bule inquired,
casting down her eyes.</p>
<p>“Zobeide, no,” I replied; “you will ever be
the favourite Sultana; the first place in my heart, and on my
throne, will be ever yours.”</p>
<p><a id="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Miss
Bule, upon that assurance, consented to propound the idea to her
seven beautiful companions.&nbsp; It occurring to me, in the
course of the same day, that we knew we could trust a grinning
and good-natured soul called Tabby, who was the serving drudge of
the house, and had no more figure than one of the beds, and upon
whose face there was always more or less black-lead, I slipped
into Miss Bule’s hand after supper, a little note to that
effect; dwelling on the black-lead as being in a manner deposited
by the finger of Providence, pointing Tabby out for Mesrour, the
celebrated chief of the Blacks of the Hareem.</p>
<p>There were difficulties in the formation of the desired
institution, as there are in all combinations.&nbsp; The other
creature showed himself of a low character, and, when defeated in
aspiring to the throne, pretended to have conscientious scruples
about prostrating himself before the Caliph; wouldn’t call
him Commander of the Faithful; spoke of him slightingly and
inconsistently as a mere “chap;” said he, the other
creature, “wouldn’t play”—Play!—and
was otherwise coarse and offensive.&nbsp; This meanness of
disposition was, however, put down by the general indignation of
an united Seraglio, and I became blessed in the smiles of eight
of the fairest of the daughters of men.</p>
<p>The smiles could only be bestowed when Miss Griffin was
looking another way, and only then in a very wary manner, for
there was a legend among the followers of the Prophet that she
saw with a little round ornament in the middle of the pattern on
the back of her shawl.&nbsp; But every day after dinner, for an
hour, we were all together, and then the Favourite and the rest
of the Royal Hareem competed who should most beguile the leisure
of the Serene Haroun reposing from the cares of State—which
were generally, as in most affairs of State, of an arithmetical
character, the Commander of the Faithful being a fearful boggler
at a sum.</p>
<p>On these occasions, the devoted Mesrour, chief of the Blacks
of the Hareem, was always in attendance (Miss Griffin usually
ringing for that officer, at the same time, with great
vehemence), but never acquitted himself in a manner worthy of his
historical reputation.&nbsp; In the first place, his bringing a
broom into the Divan of the Caliph, even when Haroun wore on his
shoulders the red robe of anger (Miss Pipson’s pelisse),
though it might be got over for the moment, was never to be quite
satisfactorily accounted for.&nbsp; In the second place, his
breaking out into grinning exclamations of “Lork you
pretties!” was neither Eastern nor respectful.&nbsp; In the
third place, when specially instructed to say
“Bismillah!” he always said
“Hallelujah!”&nbsp; This officer, unlike his class,
was too good-humoured altogether, kept his mouth open far too
wide, expressed approbation to an incongruous extent, and even
once—it was on the occasion of the purchase of the Fair
Circassian for five hundred thousand purses of gold, and cheap,
too—embraced the Slave, the Favourite, and the Caliph, all
round.&nbsp; <a id="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>(Parenthetically let me say God bless Mesrour, and may
there have been sons and daughters on that tender bosom,
softening many a hard day since!)</p>
<p>Miss Griffin was a model of propriety, and I am at a loss to
imagine what the feelings of the virtuous woman would have been,
if she had known, when she paraded us down the Hampstead Road two
and two, that she was walking with a stately step at the head of
Polygamy and Mahomedanism.&nbsp; I believe that a mysterious and
terrible joy with which the contemplation of Miss Griffin, in
this unconscious state, inspired us, and a grim sense prevalent
among us that there was a dreadful power in our knowledge of what
Miss Griffin (who knew all things that could be learnt out of
book) didn’t know, were the main-spring of the preservation
of our secret.&nbsp; It was wonderfully kept, but was once upon
the verge of self-betrayal.&nbsp; The danger and escape occurred
upon a Sunday.&nbsp; We were all ten ranged in a conspicuous part
of the gallery at church, with Miss Griffin at our head—as
we were every Sunday—advertising the establishment in an
unsecular sort of way—when the description of Solomon in
his domestic glory happened to be read.&nbsp; The moment that
monarch was thus referred to, conscience whispered me,
“Thou, too, Haroun!”&nbsp; The officiating minister
had a cast in his eye, and it assisted conscience by giving him
the appearance of reading personally at me.&nbsp; A crimson
blush, attended by a fearful perspiration, suffused my
features.&nbsp; The Grand Vizier became more dead than alive, and
the whole Seraglio reddened as if the sunset of Bagdad shone
direct upon their lovely faces.&nbsp; At this portentous time the
awful Griffin rose, and balefully surveyed the children of
Islam.&nbsp; My own impression was, that Church and State had
entered into a conspiracy with Miss Griffin to expose us, and
that we should all be put into white sheets, and exhibited in the
centre aisle.&nbsp; But, so Westerly—if I may be allowed
the expression as opposite to Eastern associations—was Miss
Griffin’s sense of rectitude, that she merely suspected
Apples, and we were saved.</p>
<p>I have called the Seraglio, united.&nbsp; Upon the question,
solely, whether the Commander of the Faithful durst exercise a
right of kissing in that sanctuary of the palace, were its
peerless inmates divided.&nbsp; Zobeide asserted a counter-right
in the Favourite to scratch, and the fair Circassian put her
face, for refuge, into a green baize bag, originally designed for
books.&nbsp; On the other hand, a young antelope of transcendent
beauty from the fruitful plains of Camden Town (whence she had
been brought, by traders, in the half-yearly caravan that crossed
the intermediate desert after the holidays), held more liberal
opinions, but stipulated for limiting the benefit of them to that
dog, and son of a dog, the Grand Vizier—who had no rights,
and was not in question.&nbsp; At length, the difficulty was
compromised by the installation of a very youthful slave as
Deputy.&nbsp; She, raised upon a stool, officially received upon
her cheeks the salutes intended by the <a id="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>gracious
Haroun for other Sultanas, and was privately rewarded from the
coffers of the Ladies of the Hareem.</p>
<p>And now it was, at the full height of enjoyment of my bliss,
that I became heavily troubled.&nbsp; I began to think of my
mother, and what she would say to my taking home at Midsummer
eight of the most beautiful of the daughters of men, but all
unexpected.&nbsp; I thought of the number of beds we made up at
our house, of my father’s income, and of the baker, and my
despondency redoubled.&nbsp; The Seraglio and malicious Vizier,
divining the cause of their Lord’s unhappiness, did their
utmost to augment it.&nbsp; They professed unbounded fidelity,
and declared that they would live and die with him.&nbsp; Reduced
to the utmost wretchedness by these protestations of attachment,
I lay awake, for hours at a time, ruminating on my frightful
lot.&nbsp; In my despair, I think I might have taken an early
opportunity of falling on my knees before Miss Griffin, avowing
my resemblance to Solomon, and praying to be dealt with according
to the outraged laws of my country, if an unthought-of means of
escape had not opened before me.</p>
<p>One day, we were out walking, two and two—on which
occasion the Vizier had his usual instructions to take note of
the boy at the turnpike, and if he profanely gazed (which he
always did) at the beauties of the Hareem, to have him bowstrung
in the course of the night—and it happened that our hearts
were veiled in gloom.&nbsp; An unaccountable action on the part
of the antelope had plunged the State into disgrace.&nbsp; That
charmer, on the representation that the previous day was her
birthday, and that vast treasures had been sent in a hamper for
its celebration (both baseless assertions), had secretly but most
pressingly invited thirty-five neighbouring princes and
princesses to a ball and supper: with a special stipulation that
they were “not to be fetched till twelve.”&nbsp; This
wandering of the antelope’s fancy, led to the surprising
arrival at Miss Griffin’s door, in divers equipages and
under various escorts, of a great company in full dress, who were
deposited on the top step in a flush of high expectancy, and who
were dismissed in tears.&nbsp; At the beginning of the double
knocks attendant on these ceremonies, the antelope had retired to
a back attic, and bolted herself in; and at every new arrival,
Miss Griffin had gone so much more and more distracted, that at
last she had been seen to tear her front.&nbsp; Ultimate
capitulation on the part of the offender, had been followed by
solitude in the linen-closet, bread and water and a lecture to
all, of vindictive length, in which Miss Griffin had used
expressions: Firstly, “I believe you all of you knew of
it;” Secondly, “Every one of you is as wicked as
another;” Thirdly, “A pack of little
wretches.”</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, we were walking drearily along; and
I especially, with my Moosulmaun responsibilities heavy on me,
was in a very low state of mind; when a strange man accosted Miss
Griffin, and, after walking on at her side for a little while and
talking with her, looked at me.&nbsp; Supposing him to be a
minion of the law, and that <a id="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>my hour was come, I instantly ran
away, with the general purpose of making for Egypt.</p>
<p>The whole Seraglio cried out, when they saw me making off as
fast as my legs would carry me (I had an impression that the
first turning on the left, and round by the public-house, would
be the shortest way to the Pyramids), Miss Griffin screamed after
me, the faithless Vizier ran after me, and the boy at the
turnpike dodged me into a corner, like a sheep, and cut me
off.&nbsp; Nobody scolded me when I was taken and brought back;
Miss Griffin only said, with a stunning gentleness, This was very
curious!&nbsp; Why had I run away when the gentleman looked at
me?</p>
<p>If I had had any breath to answer with, I dare say I should
have made no answer; having no breath, I certainly made
none.&nbsp; Miss Griffin and the strange man took me between
them, and walked me back to the palace in a sort of state; but
not at all (as I couldn’t help feeling, with astonishment)
in culprit state.</p>
<p>When we got there, we went into a room by ourselves, and Miss
Griffin called in to her assistance, Mesrour, chief of the dusky
guards of the Hareem.&nbsp; Mesrour, on being whispered to, began
to shed tears.&nbsp; “Bless you, my precious!” said
that officer, turning to me; “your Pa’s took bitter
bad!”</p>
<p>I asked, with a fluttered heart, “Is he very
ill?”</p>
<p>“Lord temper the wind to you, my lamb!” said the
good Mesrour, kneeling down, that I might have a comforting
shoulder for my head to rest on, “your Pa’s
dead!”</p>
<p>Haroun Alraschid took to flight at the words; the Seraglio
vanished; from that moment, I never again saw one of the eight of
the fairest of the daughters of men.</p>
<p>I was taken home, and there was Debt at home as well as Death,
and we had a sale there.&nbsp; My own little bed was so
superciliously looked upon by a Power unknown to me, hazily
called “The Trade,” that a brass coal-scuttle, a
roasting-jack, and a birdcage, were obliged to be put into it to
make a Lot of it, and then it went for a song.&nbsp; So I heard
mentioned, and I wondered what song, and thought what a dismal
song it must have been to sing!</p>
<p>Then, I was sent to a great, cold, bare, school of big boys;
where everything to eat and wear was thick and clumpy, without
being enough; where everybody, large and small, was cruel; where
the boys knew all about the sale, before I got there, and asked
me what I had fetched, and who had bought me, and hooted at me,
“Going, going, gone!”&nbsp; I never whispered in that
wretched place that I had been Haroun, or had had a Seraglio:
for, I knew that if I mentioned my reverses, I should be so
worried, that I should have to drown myself in the muddy pond
near the playground, which looked like the beer.</p>
<p>Ah me, ah me!&nbsp; No other ghost has haunted the boy’s
room, my friends, since I have occupied it, than the ghost of my
own childhood, the ghost of my own innocence, the ghost of my own
airy belief.&nbsp; <a id="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>Many a time have I pursued the phantom: never with this
man’s stride of mine to come up with it, never with these
man’s hands of mine to touch it, never more to this
man’s heart of mine to hold it in its purity.&nbsp; And
here you see me working out, as cheerfully and thankfully as I
may, my doom of shaving in the glass a constant change of
customers, and of lying down and rising up with the skeleton
allotted to me for my mortal companion.</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> always noticed a prevalent
want of courage, even among persons of superior intelligence and
culture, as to imparting their own psychological experiences when
those have been of a strange sort.&nbsp; Almost all men are
afraid that what they could relate in such wise would find no
parallel or response in a listener’s internal life, and
might be suspected or laughed at.&nbsp; A truthful traveller, who
should have seen some extraordinary creature in the likeness of a
sea-serpent, would have no fear of mentioning it; but the same
traveller, having had some singular presentiment, impulse, vagary
of thought, vision (so-called), dream, or other remarkable mental
impression, would hesitate considerably before he would own to
it.&nbsp; To this reticence I attribute much of the obscurity in
which such subjects are involved.&nbsp; We do not habitually
communicate our experiences of these subjective things as we do
our experiences of objective creation.&nbsp; The consequence is,
that the general stock of experience in this regard appears
exceptional, and really is so, in respect of being miserably
imperfect.</p>
<p>In what I am going to relate, I have no intention of setting
up, opposing, or supporting, any theory whatever.&nbsp; I know
the history of the Bookseller of Berlin, I have studied the case
of the wife of a late Astronomer Royal as related by Sir David
Brewster, and I have followed the minutest details of a much more
remarkable case of Spectral Illusion occurring within my private
circle of friends.&nbsp; It may be necessary to state as to this
last, that the sufferer (a lady) was in no degree, however
distant, related to me.&nbsp; A mistaken assumption on that head
might suggest an explanation of a part of my own case,—<a id="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>but only a
part,—which would be wholly without foundation.&nbsp; It
cannot be referred to my inheritance of any developed
peculiarity, nor had I ever before any at all similar experience,
nor have I ever had any at all similar experience since.</p>
<p>It does not signify how many years ago, or how few, a certain
murder was committed in England, which attracted great
attention.&nbsp; We hear more than enough of murderers as they
rise in succession to their atrocious eminence, and I would bury
the memory of this particular brute, if I could, as his body was
buried, in Newgate Jail.&nbsp; I purposely abstain from giving
any direct clue to the criminal’s individuality.</p>
<p>When the murder was first discovered, no suspicion
fell—or I ought rather to say, for I cannot be too precise
in my facts, it was nowhere publicly hinted that any suspicion
fell—on the man who was afterwards brought to trial.&nbsp;
As no reference was at that time made to him in the newspapers,
it is obviously impossible that any description of him can at
that time have been given in the newspapers.&nbsp; It is
essential that this fact be remembered.</p>
<p>Unfolding at breakfast my morning paper, containing the
account of that first discovery, I found it to be deeply
interesting, and I read it with close attention.&nbsp; I read it
twice, if not three times.&nbsp; The discovery had been made in a
bedroom, and, when I laid down the paper, I was aware of a
flash—rush—flow—I do not know what to call
it,—no word I can find is satisfactorily
descriptive,—in which I seemed to see that bedroom passing
through my room, like a picture impossibly painted on a running
river.&nbsp; Though almost instantaneous in its passing, it was
perfectly clear; so clear that I distinctly, and with a sense of
relief, observed the absence of the dead body from the bed.</p>
<p>It was in no romantic place that I had this curious sensation,
but in chambers in Piccadilly, very near to the corner of St.
James’s Street.&nbsp; It was entirely new to me.&nbsp; I
was in my easy-chair at the moment, and the sensation was
accompanied with a peculiar shiver which started the chair from
its position.&nbsp; (But it is to be noted that the chair ran
easily on castors.)&nbsp; I went to one of the windows (there are
two in the room, and the room is on the second floor) to refresh
my eyes with the moving objects down in Piccadilly.&nbsp; It was
a bright autumn morning, and the street was sparkling and
cheerful.&nbsp; The wind was high.&nbsp; As I looked out, it
brought down from the Park a quantity of fallen leaves, which a
gust took, and whirled into a spiral pillar.&nbsp; As the pillar
fell and the leaves dispersed, I saw two men on the opposite side
of the way, going from West to East.&nbsp; They were one behind
the other.&nbsp; The foremost man often looked back over his
shoulder.&nbsp; The second man followed him, at a distance of
some thirty paces, with his right hand menacingly raised.&nbsp;
First, the singularity and steadiness of this threatening gesture
in so public a thoroughfare attracted my attention; and next, the
more remarkable circumstance that nobody heeded it.&nbsp; Both
men threaded their way among the <a id="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>other passengers with a smoothness
hardly consistent even with the action of walking on a pavement;
and no single creature, that I could see, gave them place,
touched them, or looked after them.&nbsp; In passing before my
windows, they both stared up at me.&nbsp; I saw their two faces
very distinctly, and I knew that I could recognise them
anywhere.&nbsp; Not that I had consciously noticed anything very
remarkable in either face, except that the man who went first had
an unusually lowering appearance, and that the face of the man
who followed him was of the colour of impure wax.</p>
<p>I am a bachelor, and my valet and his wife constitute my whole
establishment.&nbsp; My occupation is in a certain Branch Bank,
and I wish that my duties as head of a Department were as light
as they are popularly supposed to be.&nbsp; They kept me in town
that autumn, when I stood in need of change.&nbsp; I was not ill,
but I was not well.&nbsp; My reader is to make the most that can
be reasonably made of my feeling jaded, having a depressing sense
upon me of a monotonous life, and being “slightly
dyspeptic.”&nbsp; I am assured by my renowned doctor that
my real state of health at that time justifies no stronger
description, and I quote his own from his written answer to my
request for it.</p>
<p>As the circumstances of the murder, gradually unravelling,
took stronger and stronger possession of the public mind, I kept
them away from mine by knowing as little about them as was
possible in the midst of the universal excitement.&nbsp; But I
knew that a verdict of Wilful Murder had been found against the
suspected murderer, and that he had been committed to Newgate for
trial.&nbsp; I also knew that his trial had been postponed over
one Sessions of the Central Criminal Court, on the ground of
general prejudice and want of time for the preparation of the
defence.&nbsp; I may further have known, but I believe I did not,
when, or about when, the Sessions to which his trial stood
postponed would come on.</p>
<p>My sitting-room, bedroom, and dressing-room, are all on one
floor.&nbsp; With the last there is no communication but through
the bedroom.&nbsp; True, there is a door in it, once
communicating with the staircase; but a part of the fitting of my
bath has been—and had then been for some years—fixed
across it.&nbsp; At the same period, and as a part of the same
arrangement,—the door had been nailed up and canvased
over.</p>
<p>I was standing in my bedroom late one night, giving some
directions to my servant before he went to bed.&nbsp; My face was
towards the only available door of communication with the
dressing-room, and it was closed.&nbsp; My servant’s back
was towards that door.&nbsp; While I was speaking to him, I saw
it open, and a man look in, who very earnestly and mysteriously
beckoned to me.&nbsp; That man was the man who had gone second of
the two along Piccadilly, and whose face was of the colour of
impure wax.</p>
<p>The figure, having beckoned, drew back, and closed the
door.&nbsp; With no longer pause than was made by my crossing the
bedroom, I <a id="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>opened the dressing-room door, and looked in.&nbsp; I
had a lighted candle already in my hand.&nbsp; I felt no inward
expectation of seeing the figure in the dressing-room, and I did
not see it there.</p>
<p>Conscious that my servant stood amazed, I turned round to him,
and said: “Derrick, could you believe that in my cool
senses I fancied I saw a —”&nbsp; As I there laid my
hand upon his breast, with a sudden start he trembled violently,
and said, “O Lord, yes, sir!&nbsp; A dead man
beckoning!”</p>
<p>Now I do not believe that this John Derrick, my trusty and
attached servant for more than twenty years, had any impression
whatever of having seen any such figure, until I touched
him.&nbsp; The change in him was so startling, when I touched
him, that I fully believe he derived his impression in some
occult manner from me at that instant.</p>
<p>I bade John Derrick bring some brandy, and I gave him a dram,
and was glad to take one myself.&nbsp; Of what had preceded that
night’s phenomenon, I told him not a single word.&nbsp;
Reflecting on it, I was absolutely certain that I had never seen
that face before, except on the one occasion in Piccadilly.&nbsp;
Comparing its expression when beckoning at the door with its
expression when it had stared up at me as I stood at my window, I
came to the conclusion that on the first occasion it had sought
to fasten itself upon my memory, and that on the second occasion
it had made sure of being immediately remembered.</p>
<p>I was not very comfortable that night, though I felt a
certainty, difficult to explain, that the figure would not
return.&nbsp; At daylight I fell into a heavy sleep, from which I
was awakened by John Derrick’s coming to my bedside with a
paper in his hand.</p>
<p>This paper, it appeared, had been the subject of an
altercation at the door between its bearer and my servant.&nbsp;
It was a summons to me to serve upon a Jury at the forthcoming
Sessions of the Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey.&nbsp; I
had never before been summoned on such a Jury, as John Derrick
well knew.&nbsp; He believed—I am not certain at this hour
whether with reason or otherwise—that that class of Jurors
were customarily chosen on a lower qualification than mine, and
he had at first refused to accept the summons.&nbsp; The man who
served it had taken the matter very coolly.&nbsp; He had said
that my attendance or non-attendance was nothing to him; there
the summons was; and I should deal with it at my own peril, and
not at his.</p>
<p>For a day or two I was undecided whether to respond to this
call, or take no notice of it.&nbsp; I was not conscious of the
slightest mysterious bias, influence, or attraction, one way or
other.&nbsp; Of that I am as strictly sure as of every other
statement that I make here.&nbsp; Ultimately I decided, as a
break in the monotony of my life, that I would go.</p>
<p>The appointed morning was a raw morning in the month of
November.&nbsp; There was a dense brown fog in Piccadilly, and it
became positively black and in the last degree oppressive East of
Temple Bar.&nbsp; I found the passages and staircases of the
Court-House <a id="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>flaringly lighted with gas, and the Court itself
similarly illuminated.&nbsp; I <i>think</i> that, until I was
conducted by officers into the Old Court and saw its crowded
state, I did not know that the Murderer was to be tried that
day.&nbsp; I <i>think</i> that, until I was so helped into the
Old Court with considerable difficulty, I did not know into which
of the two Courts sitting my summons would take me.&nbsp; But
this must not be received as a positive assertion, for I am not
completely satisfied in my mind on either point.</p>
<p>I took my seat in the place appropriated to Jurors in waiting,
and I looked about the Court as well as I could through the cloud
of fog and breath that was heavy in it.&nbsp; I noticed the black
vapour hanging like a murky curtain outside the great windows,
and I noticed the stifled sound of wheels on the straw or tan
that was littered in the street; also, the hum of the people
gathered there, which a shrill whistle, or a louder song or hail
than the rest, occasionally pierced.&nbsp; Soon afterwards the
Judges, two in number, entered, and took their seats.&nbsp; The
buzz in the Court was awfully hushed.&nbsp; The direction was
given to put the Murderer to the bar.&nbsp; He appeared
there.&nbsp; And in that same instant I recognised in him the
first of the two men who had gone down Piccadilly.</p>
<p>If my name had been called then, I doubt if I could have
answered to it audibly.&nbsp; But it was called about sixth or
eighth in the panel, and I was by that time able to say,
“Here!”&nbsp; Now, observe.&nbsp; As I stepped into
the box, the prisoner, who had been looking on attentively, but
with no sign of concern, became violently agitated, and beckoned
to his attorney.&nbsp; The prisoner’s wish to challenge me
was so manifest, that it occasioned a pause, during which the
attorney, with his hand upon the dock, whispered with his client,
and shook his head.&nbsp; I afterwards had it from that
gentleman, that the prisoner’s first affrighted words to
him were, “<i>At all hazards</i>, <i>challenge that
man</i>!”&nbsp; But that, as he would give no reason for
it, and admitted that he had not even known my name until he
heard it called and I appeared, it was not done.</p>
<p>Both on the ground already explained, that I wish to avoid
reviving the unwholesome memory of that Murderer, and also
because a detailed account of his long trial is by no means
indispensable to my narrative, I shall confine myself closely to
such incidents in the ten days and nights during which we, the
Jury, were kept together, as directly bear on my own curious
personal experience.&nbsp; It is in that, and not in the
Murderer, that I seek to interest my reader.&nbsp; It is to that,
and not to a page of the Newgate Calendar, that I beg
attention.</p>
<p>I was chosen Foreman of the Jury.&nbsp; On the second morning
of the trial, after evidence had been taken for two hours (I
heard the church clocks strike), happening to cast my eyes over
my brother jurymen, I found an inexplicable difficulty in
counting them.&nbsp; I counted them several times, yet always
with the same difficulty.&nbsp; In short, I made them one too
many.</p>
<p><a id="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>I
touched the brother jurymen whose place was next me, and I
whispered to him, “Oblige me by counting us.”&nbsp;
He looked surprised by the request, but turned his head and
counted. “Why,” says he, suddenly, “we are
Thirt—; but no, it’s not possible.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; We
are twelve.”</p>
<p>According to my counting that day, we were always right in
detail, but in the gross we were always one too many.&nbsp; There
was no appearance—no figure—to account for it; but I
had now an inward foreshadowing of the figure that was surely
coming.</p>
<p>The Jury were housed at the London Tavern.&nbsp; We all slept
in one large room on separate tables, and we were constantly in
the charge and under the eye of the officer sworn to hold us in
safe-keeping.&nbsp; I see no reason for suppressing the real name
of that officer.&nbsp; He was intelligent, highly polite, and
obliging, and (I was glad to hear) much respected in the
City.&nbsp; He had an agreeable presence, good eyes, enviable
black whiskers, and a fine sonorous voice.&nbsp; His name was Mr.
Harker.</p>
<p>When we turned into our twelve beds at night, Mr.
Harker’s bed was drawn across the door.&nbsp; On the night
of the second day, not being disposed to lie down, and seeing Mr.
Harker sitting on his bed, I went and sat beside him, and offered
him a pinch of snuff.&nbsp; As Mr. Harker’s hand touched
mine in taking it from my box, a peculiar shiver crossed him, and
he said, “Who is this?”</p>
<p>Following Mr. Harker’s eyes, and looking along the room,
I saw again the figure I expected,—the second of the two
men who had gone down Piccadilly.&nbsp; I rose, and advanced a
few steps; then stopped, and looked round at Mr. Harker.&nbsp; He
was quite unconcerned, laughed, and said in a pleasant way,
“I thought for a moment we had a thirteenth juryman,
without a bed.&nbsp; But I see it is the moonlight.”</p>
<p>Making no revelation to Mr. Harker, but inviting him to take a
walk with me to the end of the room, I watched what the figure
did.&nbsp; It stood for a few moments by the bedside of each of
my eleven brother jurymen, close to the pillow.&nbsp; It always
went to the right-hand side of the bed, and always passed out
crossing the foot of the next bed.&nbsp; It seemed, from the
action of the head, merely to look down pensively at each
recumbent figure.&nbsp; It took no notice of me, or of my bed,
which was that nearest to Mr. Harker’s.&nbsp; It seemed to
go out where the moonlight came in, through a high window, as by
an aërial flight of stairs.</p>
<p>Next morning at breakfast, it appeared that everybody present
had dreamed of the murdered man last night, except myself and Mr.
Harker.</p>
<p>I now felt as convinced that the second man who had gone down
Piccadilly was the murdered man (so to speak), as if it had been
borne into my comprehension by his immediate testimony.&nbsp; But
even this took place, and in a manner for which I was not at all
prepared.</p>
<p>On the fifth day of the trial, when the case for the
prosecution was <a id="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>drawing to a close, a miniature of the murdered man,
missing from his bedroom upon the discovery of the deed, and
afterwards found in a hiding-place where the Murderer had been
seen digging, was put in evidence.&nbsp; Having been identified
by the witness under examination, it was handed up to the Bench,
and thence handed down to be inspected by the Jury.&nbsp; As an
officer in a black gown was making his way with it across to me,
the figure of the second man who had gone down Piccadilly
impetuously started from the crowd, caught the miniature from the
officer, and gave it to me with his own hands, at the same time
saying, in a low and hollow tone,—before I saw the
miniature, which was in a locket,—“<i>I was younger
then</i>, <i>and my face was not then drained of
blood</i>.”&nbsp; It also came between me and the brother
juryman to whom I would have given the miniature, and between him
and the brother juryman to whom he would have given it, and so
passed it on through the whole of our number, and back into my
possession.&nbsp; Not one of them, however, detected this.</p>
<p>At table, and generally when we were shut up together in Mr.
Harker’s custody, we had from the first naturally discussed
the day’s proceedings a good deal.&nbsp; On that fifth day,
the case for the prosecution being closed, and we having that
side of the question in a completed shape before us, our
discussion was more animated and serious.&nbsp; Among our number
was a vestryman,—the densest idiot I have ever seen at
large,—who met the plainest evidence with the most
preposterous objections, and who was sided with by two flabby
parochial parasites; all the three impanelled from a district so
delivered over to Fever that they ought to have been upon their
own trial for five hundred Murders.&nbsp; When these mischievous
blockheads were at their loudest, which was towards midnight,
while some of us were already preparing for bed, I again saw the
murdered man.&nbsp; He stood grimly behind them, beckoning to
me.&nbsp; On my going towards them, and striking into the
conversation, he immediately retired.&nbsp; This was the
beginning of a separate series of appearances, confined to that
long room in which we were confined.&nbsp; Whenever a knot of my
brother jurymen laid their heads together, I saw the head of the
murdered man among theirs.&nbsp; Whenever their comparison of
notes was going against him, he would solemnly and irresistibly
beckon to me.</p>
<p>It will be borne in mind that down to the production of the
miniature, on the fifth day of the trial, I had never seen the
Appearance in Court.&nbsp; Three changes occurred now that we
entered on the case for the defence.&nbsp; Two of them I will
mention together, first.&nbsp; The figure was now in Court
continually, and it never there addressed itself to me, but
always to the person who was speaking at the time.&nbsp; For
instance: the throat of the murdered man had been cut straight
across.&nbsp; In the opening speech for the defence, it was
suggested that the deceased might have cut his own throat.&nbsp;
At that very moment, the figure, with its throat in the dreadful
condition <a id="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>referred to (this it had concealed before), stood at
the speaker’s elbow, motioning across and across its
windpipe, now with the right hand, now with the left, vigorously
suggesting to the speaker himself the impossibility of such a
wound having been self-inflicted by either hand.&nbsp; For
another instance: a witness to character, a woman, deposed to the
prisoner’s being the most amiable of mankind.&nbsp; The
figure at that instant stood on the floor before her, looking her
full in the face, and pointing out the prisoner’s evil
countenance with an extended arm and an outstretched finger.</p>
<p>The third change now to be added impressed me strongly as the
most marked and striking of all.&nbsp; I do not theorise upon it;
I accurately state it, and there leave it.&nbsp; Although the
Appearance was not itself perceived by those whom it addressed,
its coming close to such persons was invariably attended by some
trepidation or disturbance on their part.&nbsp; It seemed to me
as if it were prevented, by laws to which I was not amenable,
from fully revealing itself to others, and yet as if it could
invisibly, dumbly, and darkly overshadow their minds.&nbsp; When
the leading counsel for the defence suggested that hypothesis of
suicide, and the figure stood at the learned gentleman’s
elbow, frightfully sawing at its severed throat, it is undeniable
that the counsel faltered in his speech, lost for a few seconds
the thread of his ingenious discourse, wiped his forehead with
his handkerchief, and turned extremely pale.&nbsp; When the
witness to character was confronted by the Appearance, her eyes
most certainly did follow the direction of its pointed finger,
and rest in great hesitation and trouble upon the
prisoner’s face.&nbsp; Two additional illustrations will
suffice.&nbsp; On the eighth day of the trial, after the pause
which was every day made early in the afternoon for a few
minutes’ rest and refreshment, I came back into Court with
the rest of the Jury some little time before the return of the
Judges.&nbsp; Standing up in the box and looking about me, I
thought the figure was not there, until, chancing to raise my
eyes to the gallery, I saw it bending forward, and leaning over a
very decent woman, as if to assure itself whether the Judges had
resumed their seats or not.&nbsp; Immediately afterwards that
woman screamed, fainted, and was carried out.&nbsp; So with the
venerable, sagacious, and patient Judge who conducted the
trial.&nbsp; When the case was over, and he settled himself and
his papers to sum up, the murdered man, entering by the
Judges’ door, advanced to his Lordship’s desk, and
looked eagerly over his shoulder at the pages of his notes which
he was turning.&nbsp; A change came over his Lordship’s
face; his hand stopped; the peculiar shiver, that I knew so well,
passed over him; he faltered, “Excuse me, gentlemen, for a
few moments.&nbsp; I am somewhat oppressed by the vitiated
air;” and did not recover until he had drunk a glass of
water.</p>
<p>Through all the monotony of six of those interminable ten
days,—the same Judges and others on the bench, the same
Murderer in the dock, the same lawyers at the table, the same
tones of question and <a id="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>answer rising to the roof of the
court, the same scratching of the Judge’s pen, the same
ushers going in and out, the same lights kindled at the same hour
when there had been any natural light of day, the same foggy
curtain outside the great windows when it was foggy, the same
rain pattering and dripping when it was rainy, the same footmarks
of turnkeys and prisoner day after day on the same sawdust, the
same keys locking and unlocking the same heavy
doors,—through all the wearisome monotony which made me
feel as if I had been Foreman of the Jury for a vast period of
time, and Piccadilly had flourished coevally with Babylon, the
murdered man never lost one trace of his distinctness in my eyes,
nor was he at any moment less distinct than anybody else.&nbsp; I
must not omit, as a matter of fact, that I never once saw the
Appearance which I call by the name of the murdered man look at
the Murderer.&nbsp; Again and again I wondered, “Why does
he not?”&nbsp; But he never did.</p>
<p>Nor did he look at me, after the production of the miniature,
until the last closing minutes of the trial arrived.&nbsp; We
retired to consider, at seven minutes before ten at night.&nbsp;
The idiotic vestryman and his two parochial parasites gave us so
much trouble that we twice returned into Court to beg to have
certain extracts from the Judge’s notes re-read.&nbsp; Nine
of us had not the smallest doubt about those passages, neither, I
believe, had any one in the Court; the dunder-headed triumvirate,
having no idea but obstruction, disputed them for that very
reason.&nbsp; At length we prevailed, and finally the Jury
returned into Court at ten minutes past twelve.</p>
<p>The murdered man at that time stood directly opposite the
Jury-box, on the other side of the Court.&nbsp; As I took my
place, his eyes rested on me with great attention; he seemed
satisfied, and slowly shook a great gray veil, which he carried
on his arm for the first time, over his head and whole
form.&nbsp; As I gave in our verdict, “Guilty,” the
veil collapsed, all was gone, and his place was empty.</p>
<p>The Murderer, being asked by the Judge, according to usage,
whether he had anything to say before sentence of Death should be
passed upon him, indistinctly muttered something which was
described in the leading newspapers of the following day as
“a few rambling, incoherent, and half-audible words, in
which he was understood to complain that he had not had a fair
trial, because the Foreman of the Jury was prepossessed against
him.”&nbsp; The remarkable declaration that he really made
was this: “<i>My Lord</i>, <i>I knew I was a doomed
man</i>, <i>when the Foreman of my Jury came into the
box</i>.&nbsp; <i>My Lord</i>, <i>I knew he would never let me
off</i>, <i>because</i>, <i>before I was taken</i>, <i>he somehow
got to my bedside in the night</i>, <i>woke me</i>, <i>and put a
rope round my neck</i>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Halloa</span>!&nbsp; Below
there!”</p>
<p>When he heard a voice thus calling to him, he was standing at
the door of his box, with a flag in his hand, furled round its
short pole.&nbsp; One would have thought, considering the nature
of the ground, that he could not have doubted from what quarter
the voice came; but instead of looking up to where I stood on the
top of the steep cutting nearly over his head, he turned himself
about, and looked down the Line.&nbsp; There was something
remarkable in his manner of doing so, though I could not have
said for my life what.&nbsp; But I know it was remarkable enough
to attract my notice, even though his figure was foreshortened
and shadowed, down in the deep trench, and mine was high above
him, so steeped in the glow of an angry sunset, that I had shaded
my eyes with my hand before I saw him at all.</p>
<p>“Halloa!&nbsp; Below!”</p>
<p>From looking down the Line, he turned himself about again,
and, raising his eyes, saw my figure high above him.</p>
<p>“Is there any path by which I can come down and speak to
you?”</p>
<p>He looked up at me without replying, and I looked down at him
without pressing him too soon with a repetition of my idle
question.&nbsp; Just then there came a vague vibration in the
earth and air, quickly changing into a violent pulsation, and an
oncoming rush that caused me to start back, as though it had
force to draw me down.&nbsp; When such vapour as rose to my
height from this rapid train had passed me, and was skimming away
over the landscape, I looked down again, and saw him refurling
the flag he had shown while the train went by.</p>
<p>I repeated my inquiry.&nbsp; After a pause, during which he
seemed to regard me with fixed attention, he motioned with his
rolled-up flag towards a point on my level, some two or three
hundred yards distant.&nbsp; I called down to him, “All
right!” and made for that point.&nbsp; There, by dint of
looking closely about me, I found a rough zigzag descending path
notched out, which I followed.</p>
<p>The cutting was extremely deep, and unusually
precipitate.&nbsp; It was made through a clammy stone, that
became oozier and wetter as I went down.&nbsp; For these reasons,
I found the way long enough to give me time to recall a singular
air of reluctance or compulsion with which he had pointed out the
path.</p>
<p>When I came down low enough upon the zigzag descent to see him
again, I saw that he was standing between the rails on the way by
<a id="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>which
the train had lately passed, in an attitude as if he were waiting
for me to appear.&nbsp; He had his left hand at his chin, and
that left elbow rested on his right hand, crossed over his
breast.&nbsp; His attitude was one of such expectation and
watchfulness that I stopped a moment, wondering at it.</p>
<p>I resumed my downward way, and stepping out upon the level of
the railroad, and drawing nearer to him, saw that he was a dark,
sallow man, with a dark beard and rather heavy eyebrows.&nbsp;
His post was in as solitary and dismal a place as ever I
saw.&nbsp; On either side, a dripping-wet wall of jagged stone,
excluding all view but a strip of sky; the perspective one way
only a crooked prolongation of this great dungeon; the shorter
perspective in the other direction terminating in a gloomy red
light, and the gloomier entrance to a black tunnel, in whose
massive architecture there was a barbarous, depressing, and
forbidding air.&nbsp; So little sunlight ever found its way to
this spot, that it had an earthy, deadly smell; and so much cold
wind rushed through it, that it struck chill to me, as if I had
left the natural world.</p>
<p>Before he stirred, I was near enough to him to have touched
him.&nbsp; Not even then removing his eyes from mine, he stepped
back one step, and lifted his hand.</p>
<p>This was a lonesome post to occupy (I said), and it had
riveted my attention when I looked down from up yonder.&nbsp; A
visitor was a rarity, I should suppose; not an unwelcome rarity,
I hoped?&nbsp; In me, he merely saw a man who had been shut up
within narrow limits all his life, and who, being at last set
free, had a newly-awakened interest in these great works.&nbsp;
To such purpose I spoke to him; but I am far from sure of the
terms I used; for, besides that I am not happy in opening any
conversation, there was something in the man that daunted me.</p>
<p>He directed a most curious look towards the red light near the
tunnel’s mouth, and looked all about it, as if something
were missing from it, and then looked at me.</p>
<p>That light was part of his charge?&nbsp; Was it not?</p>
<p>He answered in a low voice,—“Don’t you know
it is?”</p>
<p>The monstrous thought came into my mind, as I perused the
fixed eyes and the saturnine face, that this was a spirit, not a
man.&nbsp; I have speculated since, whether there may have been
infection in his mind.</p>
<p>In my turn, I stepped back.&nbsp; But in making the action, I
detected in his eyes some latent fear of me.&nbsp; This put the
monstrous thought to flight.</p>
<p>“You look at me,” I said, forcing a smile,
“as if you had a dread of me.”</p>
<p>“I was doubtful,” he returned, “whether I
had seen you before.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>He pointed to the red light he had looked at.</p>
<p><a id="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>“There?” I said.</p>
<p>Intently watchful of me, he replied (but without sound),
“Yes.”</p>
<p>“My good fellow, what should I do there?&nbsp; However,
be that as it may, I never was there, you may swear.”</p>
<p>“I think I may,” he rejoined.&nbsp; “Yes; I
am sure I may.”</p>
<p>His manner cleared, like my own.&nbsp; He replied to my
remarks with readiness, and in well-chosen words.&nbsp; Had he
much to do there?&nbsp; Yes; that was to say, he had enough
responsibility to bear; but exactness and watchfulness were what
was required of him, and of actual work—manual
labour—he had next to none.&nbsp; To change that signal, to
trim those lights, and to turn this iron handle now and then, was
all he had to do under that head.&nbsp; Regarding those many long
and lonely hours of which I seemed to make so much, he could only
say that the routine of his life had shaped itself into that
form, and he had grown used to it.&nbsp; He had taught himself a
language down here,—if only to know it by sight, and to
have formed his own crude ideas of its pronunciation, could be
called learning it.&nbsp; He had also worked at fractions and
decimals, and tried a little algebra; but he was, and had been as
a boy, a poor hand at figures.&nbsp; Was it necessary for him
when on duty always to remain in that channel of damp air, and
could he never rise into the sunshine from between those high
stone walls?&nbsp; Why, that depended upon times and
circumstances.&nbsp; Under some conditions there would be less
upon the Line than under others, and the same held good as to
certain hours of the day and night.&nbsp; In bright weather, he
did choose occasions for getting a little above these lower
shadows; but, being at all times liable to be called by his
electric bell, and at such times listening for it with redoubled
anxiety, the relief was less than I would suppose.</p>
<p>He took me into his box, where there was a fire, a desk for an
official book in which he had to make certain entries, a
telegraphic instrument with its dial, face, and needles, and the
little bell of which he had spoken.&nbsp; On my trusting that he
would excuse the remark that he had been well educated, and (I
hoped I might say without offence) perhaps educated above that
station, he observed that instances of slight incongruity in such
wise would rarely be found wanting among large bodies of men;
that he had heard it was so in workhouses, in the police force,
even in that last desperate resource, the army; and that he knew
it was so, more or less, in any great railway staff.&nbsp; He had
been, when young (if I could believe it, sitting in that
hut,—he scarcely could), a student of natural philosophy,
and had attended lectures; but he had run wild, misused his
opportunities, gone down, and never risen again.&nbsp; He had no
complaint to offer about that.&nbsp; He had made his bed, and he
lay upon it.&nbsp; It was far too late to make another.</p>

</a></p>
<p>All that I have here condensed he said in a quiet manner, with
his grave, dark regards divided between me and the fire.&nbsp; He
threw in the word, “Sir,” from time to time, and
especially when he referred <a id="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>to his youth,—as though to
request me to understand that he claimed to be nothing but what I
found him.&nbsp; He was several times interrupted by the little
bell, and had to read off messages, and send replies.&nbsp; Once
he had to stand without the door, and display a flag as a train
passed, and make some verbal communication to the driver.&nbsp;
In the discharge of his duties, I observed him to be remarkably
exact and vigilant, breaking off his discourse at a syllable, and
remaining silent until what he had to do was done.</p>
<p>In a word, I should have set this man down as one of the
safest of men to be employed in that capacity, but for the
circumstance that while he was speaking to me he twice broke off
with a fallen colour, turned his face towards the little bell
when it did <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span> ring, opened the
door of the hut (which was kept shut to exclude the unhealthy
damp), and looked out towards the red light near the mouth of the
tunnel.&nbsp; On both of those occasions, he came back to the
fire with the inexplicable air upon him which I had remarked,
without being able to define, when we were so far asunder.</p>
<p>Said I, when I rose to leave him, “You almost make me
think that I have met with a contented man.”</p>
<p>(I am afraid I must acknowledge that I said it to lead him
on.)</p>
<p>“I believe I used to be so,” he rejoined, in the
low voice in which he had first spoken; “but I am troubled,
sir, I am troubled.”</p>
<p>He would have recalled the words if he could.&nbsp; He had
said them, however, and I took them up quickly.</p>
<p>“With what?&nbsp; What is your trouble?”</p>
<p>“It is very difficult to impart, sir.&nbsp; It is very,
very difficult to speak of.&nbsp; If ever you make me another
visit, I will try to tell you.”</p>
<p>“But I expressly intend to make you another visit.&nbsp;
Say, when shall it be?”</p>
<p>“I go off early in the morning, and I shall be on again
at ten to-morrow night, sir.”</p>
<p>“I will come at eleven.”</p>
<p>He thanked me, and went out at the door with me.&nbsp;
“I’ll show my white light, sir,” he said, in
his peculiar low voice, “till you have found the way
up.&nbsp; When you have found it, don’t call out!&nbsp; And
when you are at the top, don’t call out!”</p>
<p>His manner seemed to make the place strike colder to me, but I
said no more than, “Very well.”</p>
<p>“And when you come down to-morrow night, don’t
call out!&nbsp; Let me ask you a parting question.&nbsp; What
made you cry, ‘Halloa!&nbsp; Below there!’
to-night?”</p>
<p>“Heaven knows,” said I.&nbsp; “I cried
something to that effect—”</p>
<p>“Not to that effect, sir.&nbsp; Those were the very
words.&nbsp; I know them well.”</p>
<p>“Admit those were the very words.&nbsp; I said them, no
doubt, because I saw you below.”</p>
<p><a id="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>“For no other reason?”</p>
<p>“What other reason could I possibly have?”</p>
<p>“You had no feeling that they were conveyed to you in
any supernatural way?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He wished me good-night, and held up his light.&nbsp; I walked
by the side of the down Line of rails (with a very disagreeable
sensation of a train coming behind me) until I found the
path.&nbsp; It was easier to mount than to descend, and I got
back to my inn without any adventure.</p>
<p>Punctual to my appointment, I placed my foot on the first
notch of the zigzag next night, as the distant clocks were
striking eleven.&nbsp; He was waiting for me at the bottom, with
his white light on.&nbsp; “I have not called out,” I
said, when we came close together; “may I speak
now?”&nbsp; “By all means, sir.”&nbsp;
“Good-night, then, and here’s my hand.”&nbsp;
“Good-night, sir, and here’s mine.”&nbsp; With
that we walked side by side to his box, entered it, closed the
door, and sat down by the fire.</p>
<p>“I have made up my mind, sir,” he began, bending
forward as soon as we were seated, and speaking in a tone but a
little above a whisper, “that you shall not have to ask me
twice what troubles me.&nbsp; I took you for some one else
yesterday evening.&nbsp; That troubles me.”</p>
<p>“That mistake?”</p>
<p>“No.&nbsp; That some one else.”</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Like me?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.&nbsp; I never saw the face.&nbsp;
The left arm is across the face, and the right arm is
waved,—violently waved.&nbsp; This way.”</p>
<p>I followed his action with my eyes, and it was the action of
an arm gesticulating, with the utmost passion and vehemence,
“For God’s sake, clear the way!”</p>
<p>“One moonlight night,” said the man, “I was
sitting here, when I heard a voice cry, ‘Halloa!&nbsp;
Below there!’&nbsp; I started up, looked from that door,
and saw this Some one else standing by the red light near the
tunnel, waving as I just now showed you.&nbsp; The voice seemed
hoarse with shouting, and it cried, ‘Look out!&nbsp; Look
out!’&nbsp; And then again, ‘Halloa!&nbsp; Below
there!&nbsp; Look out!’&nbsp; I caught up my lamp, turned
it on red, and ran towards the figure, calling,
‘What’s wrong?&nbsp; What has happened?&nbsp;
Where?’&nbsp; It stood just outside the blackness of the
tunnel.&nbsp; I advanced so close upon it that I wondered at its
keeping the sleeve across its eyes.&nbsp; I ran right up at it,
and had my hand stretched out to pull the sleeve away, when it
was gone.”</p>
<p>“Into the tunnel?” said I.</p>
<p>“No.&nbsp; I ran on into the tunnel, five hundred
yards.&nbsp; I stopped, and held my lamp above my head, and saw
the figures of the measured distance, and saw the wet stains
stealing down the walls and trickling <a id="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>through the arch.&nbsp; I ran out
again faster than I had run in (for I had a mortal abhorrence of
the place upon me), and I looked all round the red light with my
own red light, and I went up the iron ladder to the gallery atop
of it, and I came down again, and ran back here.&nbsp; I
telegraphed both ways, ‘An alarm has been given.&nbsp; Is
anything wrong?’&nbsp; The answer came back, both ways,
‘All well.’”</p>
<p>Resisting the slow touch of a frozen finger tracing out my
spine, I showed him how that this figure must be a deception of
his sense of sight; and how that figures, originating in disease
of the delicate nerves that minister to the functions of the eye,
were known to have often troubled patients, some of whom had
become conscious of the nature of their affliction, and had even
proved it by experiments upon themselves.&nbsp; “As to an
imaginary cry,” said I, “do but listen for a moment
to the wind in this unnatural valley while we speak so low, and
to the wild harp it makes of the telegraph wires.”</p>
<p>That was all very well, he returned, after we had sat
listening for a while, and he ought to know something of the wind
and the wires,—he who so often passed long winter nights
there, alone and watching.&nbsp; But he would beg to remark that
he had not finished.</p>
<p>I asked his pardon, and he slowly added these words, touching
my arm,—</p>
<p>“Within six hours after the Appearance, the memorable
accident on this Line happened, and within ten hours the dead and
wounded were brought along through the tunnel over the spot where
the figure had stood.”</p>
<p>A disagreeable shudder crept over me, but I did my best
against it.&nbsp; It was not to be denied, I rejoined, that this
was a remarkable coincidence, calculated deeply to impress his
mind.&nbsp; But it was unquestionable that remarkable
coincidences did continually occur, and they must be taken into
account in dealing with such a subject.&nbsp; Though to be sure I
must admit, I added (for I thought I saw that he was going to
bring the objection to bear upon me), men of common sense did not
allow much for coincidences in making the ordinary calculations
of life.</p>
<p>He again begged to remark that he had not finished.</p>
<p>I again begged his pardon for being betrayed into
interruptions.</p>
<p>“This,” he said, again laying his hand upon my
arm, and glancing over his shoulder with hollow eyes, “was
just a year ago.&nbsp; Six or seven months passed, and I had
recovered from the surprise and shock, when one morning, as the
day was breaking, I, standing at the door, looked towards the red
light, and saw the spectre again.”&nbsp; He stopped, with a
fixed look at me.</p>
<p>“Did it cry out?”</p>
<p>“No.&nbsp; It was silent.”</p>
<p>“Did it wave its arm?”</p>
<p>“No.&nbsp; It leaned against the shaft of the light,
with both hands before the face.&nbsp; Like this.”</p>
<p><a id="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>Once
more I followed his action with my eyes.&nbsp; It was an action
of mourning.&nbsp; I have seen such an attitude in stone figures
on tombs.</p>
<p>“Did you go up to it?”</p>
<p>“I came in and sat down, partly to collect my thoughts,
partly because it had turned me faint.&nbsp; When I went to the
door again, daylight was above me, and the ghost was
gone.”</p>
<p>“But nothing followed?&nbsp; Nothing came of
this?”</p>
<p>He touched me on the arm with his forefinger twice or thrice
giving a ghastly nod each time:—</p>
<p>“That very day, as a train came out of the tunnel, I
noticed, at a carriage window on my side, what looked like a
confusion of hands and heads, and something waved.&nbsp; I saw it
just in time to signal the driver, Stop!&nbsp; He shut off, and
put his brake on, but the train drifted past here a hundred and
fifty yards or more.&nbsp; I ran after it, and, as I went along,
heard terrible screams and cries.&nbsp; A beautiful young lady
had died instantaneously in one of the compartments, and was
brought in here, and laid down on this floor between
us.”</p>
<p>Involuntarily I pushed my chair back, as I looked from the
boards at which he pointed to himself.</p>
<p>“True, sir.&nbsp; True.&nbsp; Precisely as it happened,
so I tell it you.”</p>
<p>I could think of nothing to say, to any purpose, and my mouth
was very dry.&nbsp; The wind and the wires took up the story with
a long lamenting wail.</p>
<p>He resumed.&nbsp; “Now, sir, mark this, and judge how my
mind is troubled.&nbsp; The spectre came back a week ago.&nbsp;
Ever since, it has been there, now and again, by fits and
starts.”</p>
<p>“At the light?”</p>
<p>“At the Danger-light.”</p>
<p>“What does it seem to do?”</p>
<p>He repeated, if possible with increased passion and vehemence,
that former gesticulation of, “For God’s sake, clear
the way!”</p>
<p>Then he went on.&nbsp; “I have no peace or rest for
it.&nbsp; It calls to me, for many minutes together, in an
agonised manner, ‘Below there!&nbsp; Look out!&nbsp; Look
out!’&nbsp; It stands waving to me.&nbsp; It rings my
little bell—”</p>
<p>I caught at that.&nbsp; “Did it ring your bell yesterday
evening when I was here, and you went to the door?”</p>
<p>“Twice.”</p>
<p>“Why, see,” said I, “how your imagination
misleads you.&nbsp; My eyes were on the bell, and my ears were
open to the bell, and if I am a living man, it did <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span> ring at those times.&nbsp; No, nor at
any other time, except when it was rung in the natural course of
physical things by the station communicating with you.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “I have never made a mistake as to
that yet, sir.&nbsp; I have never confused the spectre’s
ring with the man’s.&nbsp; The ghost’s ring is a
strange vibration in the bell that it derives from <a id="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>nothing
else, and I have not asserted that the bell stirs to the
eye.&nbsp; I don’t wonder that you failed to hear it.&nbsp;
But <i>I</i> heard it.”</p>
<p>“And did the spectre seem to be there, when you looked
out?”</p>
<p>“It <span class="GutSmall">WAS</span> there.”</p>
<p>“Both times?”</p>
<p>He repeated firmly: “Both times.”</p>
<p>“Will you come to the door with me, and look for it
now?”</p>
<p>He bit his under lip as though he were somewhat unwilling, but
arose.&nbsp; I opened the door, and stood on the step, while he
stood in the doorway.&nbsp; There was the Danger-light.&nbsp;
There was the dismal mouth of the tunnel.&nbsp; There were the
high, wet stone walls of the cutting.&nbsp; There were the stars
above them.</p>
<p>“Do you see it?” I asked him, taking particular
note of his face.&nbsp; His eyes were prominent and strained, but
not very much more so, perhaps, than my own had been when I had
directed them earnestly towards the same spot.</p>
<p>“No,” he answered.&nbsp; “It is not
there.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” said I.</p>
<p>We went in again, shut the door, and resumed our seats.&nbsp;
I was thinking how best to improve this advantage, if it might be
called one, when he took up the conversation in such a
matter-of-course way, so assuming that there could be no serious
question of fact between us, that I felt myself placed in the
weakest of positions.</p>
<p>“By this time you will fully understand, sir,” he
said, “that what troubles me so dreadfully is the question,
What does the spectre mean?”</p>
<p>I was not sure, I told him, that I did fully understand.</p>
<p>“What is its warning against?” he said,
ruminating, with his eyes on the fire, and only by times turning
them on me.&nbsp; “What is the danger?&nbsp; Where is the
danger?&nbsp; There is danger overhanging somewhere on the
Line.&nbsp; Some dreadful calamity will happen.&nbsp; It is not
to be doubted this third time, after what has gone before.&nbsp;
But surely this is a cruel haunting of me.&nbsp; What can I
do?”</p>
<p>He pulled out his handkerchief, and wiped the drops from his
heated forehead.</p>
<p>“If I telegraph Danger, on either side of me, or on
both, I can give no reason for it,” he went on, wiping the
palms of his hands.&nbsp; “I should get into trouble, and
do no good.&nbsp; They would think I was mad.&nbsp; This is the
way it would work,—Message: ‘Danger!&nbsp; Take
care!’&nbsp; Answer: ‘What Danger?&nbsp;
Where?’&nbsp; Message: ‘Don’t know.&nbsp; But,
for God’s sake, take care!’&nbsp; They would displace
me.&nbsp; What else could they do?”</p>
<p>His pain of mind was most pitiable to see.&nbsp; It was the
mental torture of a conscientious man, oppressed beyond endurance
by an unintelligible responsibility involving life.</p>
<p>“When it first stood under the Danger-light,” he
went on, putting his dark hair back from his head, and drawing
his hands outward <a id="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>across and across his temples in an extremity of
feverish distress, “why not tell me where that accident was
to happen,—if it must happen?&nbsp; Why not tell me how it
could be averted,—if it could have been averted?&nbsp; When
on its second coming it hid its face, why not tell me, instead,
‘She is going to die.&nbsp; Let them keep her at
home’?&nbsp; If it came, on those two occasions, only to
show me that its warnings were true, and so to prepare me for the
third, why not warn me plainly now?&nbsp; And I, Lord help
me!&nbsp; A mere poor signal-man on this solitary station!&nbsp;
Why not go to somebody with credit to be believed, and power to
act?”</p>
<p>When I saw him in this state, I saw that for the poor
man’s sake, as well as for the public safety, what I had to
do for the time was to compose his mind.&nbsp; Therefore, setting
aside all question of reality or unreality between us, I
represented to him that whoever thoroughly discharged his duty
must do well, and that at least it was his comfort that he
understood his duty, though he did not understand these
confounding Appearances.&nbsp; In this effort I succeeded far
better than in the attempt to reason him out of his
conviction.&nbsp; He became calm; the occupations incidental to
his post as the night advanced began to make larger demands on
his attention: and I left him at two in the morning.&nbsp; I had
offered to stay through the night, but he would not hear of
it.</p>
<p>That I more than once looked back at the red light as I
ascended the pathway, that I did not like the red light, and that
I should have slept but poorly if my bed had been under it, I see
no reason to conceal.&nbsp; Nor did I like the two sequences of
the accident and the dead girl.&nbsp; I see no reason to conceal
that either.</p>
<p>But what ran most in my thoughts was the consideration how
ought I to act, having become the recipient of this
disclosure?&nbsp; I had proved the man to be intelligent,
vigilant, painstaking, and exact; but how long might he remain
so, in his state of mind?&nbsp; Though in a subordinate position,
still he held a most important trust, and would I (for instance)
like to stake my own life on the chances of his continuing to
execute it with precision?</p>
<p>Unable to overcome a feeling that there would be something
treacherous in my communicating what he had told me to his
superiors in the Company, without first being plain with himself
and proposing a middle course to him, I ultimately resolved to
offer to accompany him (otherwise keeping his secret for the
present) to the wisest medical practitioner we could hear of in
those parts, and to take his opinion.&nbsp; A change in his time
of duty would come round next night, he had apprised me, and he
would be off an hour or two after sunrise, and on again soon
after sunset.&nbsp; I had appointed to return accordingly.</p>
<p>Next evening was a lovely evening, and I walked out early to
enjoy it.&nbsp; The sun was not yet quite down when I traversed
the field-path near the top of the deep cutting.&nbsp; I would
extend my walk for an <a id="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>hour, I said to myself, half an hour
on and half an hour back, and it would then be time to go to my
signal-man’s box.</p>
<p>Before pursuing my stroll, I stepped to the brink, and
mechanically looked down, from the point from which I had first
seen him.&nbsp; I cannot describe the thrill that seized upon me,
when, close at the mouth of the tunnel, I saw the appearance of a
man, with his left sleeve across his eyes, passionately waving
his right arm.</p>
<p>The nameless horror that oppressed me passed in a moment, for
in a moment I saw that this appearance of a man was a man indeed,
and that there was a little group of other men, standing at a
short distance, to whom he seemed to be rehearsing the gesture he
made.&nbsp; The Danger-light was not yet lighted.&nbsp; Against
its shaft, a little low hut, entirely new to me, had been made of
some wooden supports and tarpaulin.&nbsp; It looked no bigger
than a bed.</p>
<p>With an irresistible sense that something was
wrong,—with a flashing self-reproachful fear that fatal
mischief had come of my leaving the man there, and causing no one
to be sent to overlook or correct what he did,—I descended
the notched path with all the speed I could make.</p>
<p>“What is the matter?” I asked the men.</p>
<p>“Signal-man killed this morning, sir.”</p>
<p>“Not the man belonging to that box?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Not the man I know?”</p>
<p>“You will recognise him, sir, if you knew him,”
said the man who spoke for the others, solemnly uncovering his
own head, and raising an end of the tarpaulin, “for his
face is quite composed.”</p>
<p>“O, how did this happen, how did this happen?” I
asked, turning from one to another as the hut closed in
again.</p>
<p>“He was cut down by an engine, sir.&nbsp; No man in
England knew his work better.&nbsp; But somehow he was not clear
of the outer rail.&nbsp; It was just at broad day.&nbsp; He had
struck the light, and had the lamp in his hand.&nbsp; As the
engine came out of the tunnel, his back was towards her, and she
cut him down.&nbsp; That man drove her, and was showing how it
happened.&nbsp; Show the gentleman, Tom.”</p>
<p>The man, who wore a rough dark dress, stepped back to his
former place at the mouth of the tunnel.</p>
<p>“Coming round the curve in the tunnel, sir,” he
said, “I saw him at the end, like as if I saw him down a
perspective-glass.&nbsp; There was no time to check speed, and I
knew him to be very careful.&nbsp; As he didn’t seem to
take heed of the whistle, I shut it off when we were running down
upon him, and called to him as loud as I could call.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Below there!&nbsp; Look out!&nbsp; Look
out!&nbsp; For God’s sake, clear the way!’”</p>
<p>I started.</p>
<p>“Ah! it was a dreadful time, sir.&nbsp; I never left off
calling to him.&nbsp; <a id="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>I put this arm before my eyes not to
see, and I waved this arm to the last; but it was no
use.”</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Without prolonging the narrative to dwell on any one of its
curious circumstances more than on any other, I may, in closing
it, point out the coincidence that the warning of the
Engine-Driver included, not only the words which the unfortunate
Signal-man had repeated to me as haunting him, but also the words
which I myself—not he—had attached, and that only in
my own mind, to the gesticulation he had imitated.</p>

        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

        works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
